        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have availed
        myself of the interval since the last edition, to subject this book
        to a minute and careful revision, removing such inaccuracies as I
        have been able myself to discover, as well as those which have been
        brought under my notice by reviewers or correspondents. I must
        especially acknowledge the great assistance I have derived in this
        task from my German translator, Dr. H. Jolowicz—now, unhappily, no
        more—one of the most conscientious and accurate scholars with whom I
        have ever been in communication. In the controversial part of the
        first chapter, which has given rise to a good deal of angry
        discussion, four or five lines which stood in the former editions
        have been omitted, and three or four short passages have been
        inserted, elucidating or supporting positions which had been
        misunderstood or contested.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The questions with
        which an historian of Morals is chiefly concerned are the changes
        that have taken place in the moral standard and in the moral type. By
        the first, I understand the degrees in which, in different ages,
        recognised virtues have been enjoined and practised. By the second, I
        understand the relative importance that in different ages has been
        attached to different virtues. Thus, for example, a Roman of the age
        of Pliny, an Englishman of the age of Henry VIII., and an Englishman
        of our own day, would all agree in regarding humanity as a virtue,
        and its opposite as a vice; but their judgments of the acts which are
        compatible with a humane disposition would be widely different. A
        humane man of the first period might derive a keen enjoyment from
        those gladiatorial games, which an Englishman, even in the days of
        the Tudors, would regard as atrociously barbarous; and this last
        would, in his turn, acquiesce in many sport <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> which would now be emphatically condemned. And
        in addition to this change of standard, there is a continual change
        in the order of precedence which is given to virtues. Patriotism,
        chastity, charity, and humility are examples of virtues, each of
        which has in some ages been brought forward as of the most supreme
        and transcendent importance, and the very basis of a virtuous
        character, and in other ages been thrown into the background, and
        reckoned among the minor graces of a noble life. The heroic virtues,
        the amiable virtues, and what are called more especially the
        religious virtues, form distinct groups, to which, in different
        periods, different degrees of prominence have been assigned; and the
        nature, causes, and consequences of these changes in the moral type
        are among the most important branches of history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In estimating,
        however, the moral condition of an age, it is not sufficient to
        examine the ideal of moralists. It is necessary also to enquire how
        far that ideal has been realised among the people. The corruption of
        a nation is often reflected in the indulgent and selfish ethics of
        its teachers; but it sometimes produces a reaction, and impels the
        moralist to an asceticism which is the extreme opposite of the
        prevailing spirit of society. The means which moral teachers possess
        of acting upon their fellows, vary greatly in their nature and
        efficacy, and the age of the highest moral teaching is often not that
        of the highest general <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg
        ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> level
        of practice. Sometimes we find a kind of aristocracy of virtue,
        exhibiting the most refined excellence in their teaching and in their
        actions, but exercising scarcely any appreciable influence upon the
        mass of the community. Sometimes we find moralists of a much less
        heroic order, whose influence has permeated every section of society.
        In addition, therefore, to the type and standard of morals inculcated
        by the teachers, an historian must investigate the realised morals of
        the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The three
        questions I have now briefly indicated are those which I have
        especially regarded in examining the moral history of Europe between
        Augustus and Charlemagne. As a preliminary to this enquiry, I have
        discussed at some length the rival theories concerning the nature and
        obligations of morals, and have also endeavoured to show what virtues
        are especially appropriate to each successive stage of civilisation,
        in order that we may afterwards ascertain to what extent the natural
        evolution has been affected by special agencies. I have then followed
        the moral history of the Pagan Empire, reviewing the Stoical, the
        Eclectic, and the Egyptian philosophies, that in turn flourished,
        showing in what respects they were the products or expressions of the
        general condition of society, tracing their influence in many
        departments of legislation and literature, and investigating the
        causes of the deep-seated corruption which baffled all the efforts of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id=
        "Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> emperors and philosophers. The
        triumph of the Christian religion in Europe next demands our
        attention. In treating this subject, I have endeavoured, for the most
        part, to exclude all considerations of a purely theological or
        controversial character, all discussions concerning the origin of the
        faith in Palestine, and concerning the first type of its doctrine,
        and to regard the Church simply as a moral agent, exercising its
        influence in Europe. Confining myself within these limits, I have
        examined the manner in which the circumstances of the Pagan Empire
        impeded or assisted its growth, the nature of the opposition it had
        to encounter, the transformations it underwent under the influence of
        prosperity, of the ascetic enthusiasm, and of the barbarian
        invasions, and the many ways in which it determined the moral
        condition of society. The growing sense of the sanctity of human
        life, the history of charity, the formation of the legends of the
        hagiology, the effects of asceticism upon civic and domestic virtues,
        the moral influence of monasteries, the ethics of the intellect, the
        virtues and vices of the decaying Christian Empire and of the
        barbarian kingdoms that replaced it, the gradual apotheosis of
        secular rank, and the first stages of that military Christianity
        which attained its climax at the Crusades, have been all discussed
        with more or less detail; and I have concluded my work by reviewing
        the changes that have taken place in the position of women, and in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexi">[pg xi]</span><a name="Pgxi" id=
        "Pgxi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the moral questions connected with
        the relations of the sexes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In investigating
        these numerous subjects, it has occasionally, though rarely, happened
        that my path has intersected that which I had pursued in a former
        work, and in two or three instances I have not hesitated to repeat
        facts to which I had there briefly referred. I have thought that such
        a course was preferable to presenting the subject shorn of some
        material incident, or to falling into what has always the appearance
        of an unpleasing egotism, by appealing unnecessarily to my own
        writings. Although the history of the period I have traced has never,
        so far as I am aware, been written from exactly the point of view
        which I have adopted, I have, of course, been for the most part
        moving over familiar ground, which has been often and ably
        investigated; and any originality that may be found in this work must
        lie, not so much in the facts which have been exhumed, as in the
        manner in which they have been grouped, and in the significance that
        has been ascribed to them. I have endeavoured to acknowledge the more
        important works from which I have derived assistance; and if I have
        not always done so, I trust the reader will ascribe it to the great
        multitude of the special histories relating to the subjects I have
        treated, to my unwillingness to overload my pages with too numerous
        references, and perhaps, in some cases, to the difficulty that all
        who <span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagexii">[pg xii]</span><a name=
        "Pgxii" id="Pgxii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have been much
        occupied with a single department of history must sometimes have, in
        distinguishing the ideas which have sprung from their own
        reflections, from those which have been derived from books.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is one
        writer, however, whom I must especially mention, for his name occurs
        continually in the following pages, and his memory has been more
        frequently, and in these latter months more sadly, present to my mind
        than any other. Brilliant and numerous as are the works of the late
        Dean Milman, it was those only who had the great privilege of his
        friendship, who could fully realise the amazing extent and variety of
        his knowledge; the calm, luminous, and delicate judgment which he
        carried into so many spheres; the inimitable grace and tact of his
        conversation, coruscating with the happiest anecdotes, and the
        brightest and yet the gentlest humour; and, what was perhaps more
        remarkable than any single faculty, the admirable harmony and
        symmetry of his mind and character, so free from all the
        disproportion, and eccentricity, and exaggeration that sometimes make
        even genius assume the form of a splendid disease. They can never
        forget those yet higher attributes, which rendered him so unspeakably
        reverend to all who knew him well—his fervent love of truth, his wide
        tolerance, his large, generous, and masculine judgments <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="pagexiii">[pg xiii]</span><a name="Pgxiii" id=
        "Pgxiii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of men and things; his almost
        instinctive perception of the good that is latent in each opposing
        party, his disdain for the noisy triumphs and the fleeting popularity
        of mere sectarian strife, the fond and touching affection with which
        he dwelt upon the images of the past, combining, even in extreme old
        age, with the keenest and most hopeful insight into the progressive
        movements of his time, and with a rare power of winning the
        confidence and reading the thoughts of the youngest about him. That
        such a writer should have devoted himself to the department of
        history, which more than any other has been distorted by ignorance,
        puerility, and dishonesty, I conceive to be one of the happiest facts
        in English literature, and (though sometimes diverging from his
        views) in many parts of the following work I have largely availed
        myself of his researches.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I cannot conceal
        from myself that this book is likely to encounter much, and probably
        angry, contradiction from different quarters and on different
        grounds. It is strongly opposed to a school of moral philosophy which
        is at present extremely influential in England; and, in addition to
        the many faults that may be found in its execution, its very plan
        must make it displeasing to many. Its subject necessarily includes
        questions on which it is exceedingly difficult for an English writer
        to touch, and the portion of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pagexiv">[pg xiv]</span><a name="Pgxiv" id="Pgxiv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> history with which it is concerned has been
        obscured by no common measure of misrepresentation and passion. I
        have endeavoured to carry into it a judicial impartiality, and I
        trust that the attempt, however imperfect, may not be wholly useless
        to my readers.</p>

        Morals.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A brief enquiry
        into the nature and foundations of morals appears an obvious, and,
        indeed, almost an indispensable preliminary, to any examination of
        the moral progress of Europe. Unfortunately, however, such an enquiry
        is beset with serious difficulties, arising in part from the extreme
        multiplicity of detail which systems of moral philosophy present, and
        in part from a fundamental antagonism of principles, dividing them
        into two opposing groups. The great controversy, springing from the
        rival claims of intuition and utility to be regarded as the supreme
        regulator of moral distinctions, may be dimly traced in the division
        between Plato and Aristotle; it appeared more clearly in the division
        between the Stoics and the Epicureans; but it has only acquired its
        full distinctness of definition, and the importance of the questions
        depending on it has only been fully appreciated, in modern times,
        under the influence of such writers as Cudworth, Clarke, and Butler
        upon the one side, and Hobbes, Helvétius, and Bentham on the
        other.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg
        002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Independently of
        the broad intellectual difficulties which must be encountered in
        treating this question, there is a difficulty of a personal kind,
        which it may be advisable at once to meet. There is a disposition in
        some moralists to resent, as an imputation against their own
        characters, any charge of immoral consequences that may be brought
        against the principles they advocate. Now it is a peculiarity of this
        controversy that every moralist is compelled, by the very nature of
        the case, to bring such charges against the opinions of his
        opponents. The business of a moral philosophy is to account for and
        to justify our moral sentiments, or in other words, to show how we
        come to have our notions of duty, and to supply us with a reason for
        acting upon them. If it does this adequately, it is impregnable, and
        therefore a moralist who repudiates one system is called upon to show
        that, according to its principles, the notion of duty, or the motives
        for performing it, could never have been generated. The Utilitarian
        accuses his opponent of basing the entire system of morals on a
        faculty that has no existence, of adopting a principle that would
        make moral duty vary with the latitude and the epoch, of resolving
        all ethics into an idle sentiment. The intuitive moralist, for
        reasons I shall hereafter explain, believes that the Utilitarian
        theory is profoundly immoral. But to suppose that either of these
        charges extends to the character of the moralist is altogether to
        misconceive the position which moral theories actually hold in life.
        Our moral sentiments do not flow from, but long precede our ethical
        systems; and it is usually only after our characters have been fully
        formed that we begin to reason about them. It is both possible and
        very common for the reasoning to be very defective, without any
        corresponding imperfection in the disposition of the man.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two rival
        theories of morals are known by many names, and are subdivided into
        many groups. One of them is generally described as the stoical, the
        intuitive, the independent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg
        003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or
        the sentimental; the other as the epicurean, the inductive, the
        utilitarian, or the selfish. The moralists of the former school, to
        state their opinions in the broadest form, believe that we have a
        natural power of perceiving that some qualities, such as benevolence,
        chastity, or veracity, are better than others, and that we ought to
        cultivate them, and to repress their opposites. In other words, they
        contend, that by the constitution of our nature, the notion of right
        carries with it a feeling of obligation; that to say a course of
        conduct is our duty, is in itself, and apart from all consequences,
        an intelligible and sufficient reason for practising it; and that we
        derive the first principles of our duties from intuition. The
        moralist of the opposite school denies that we have any such natural
        perception. He maintains that we have by nature absolutely no
        knowledge of merit and demerit, of the comparative excellence of our
        feelings and actions, and that we derive these notions solely from an
        observation of the course of life which is conducive to human
        happiness. That which makes actions good is, that they increase the
        happiness or diminish the pains of mankind. That which constitutes
        their demerit is their opposite tendency. To procure <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the greatest happiness for the greatest number,”</span>
        is therefore the highest aim of the moralist, the supreme type and
        expression of virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest,
        however, that this last school, if it proceeded no further than I
        have stated, would have failed to accomplish the task which every
        moralist must undertake. It is easy to understand that experience may
        show that certain actions are conducive to the happiness of mankind,
        and that these actions may in consequence be regarded as supremely
        excellent. The question still remains, why we are bound to perform
        them. If men, who believe that virtuous actions are those which
        experience shows to be useful to society, believe also that they are
        under a natural obligation to seek the happiness of others, rather
        than their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg
        004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        own, when the two interests conflict, they have certainly no claim to
        the title of inductive moralists. They recognise a moral faculty, or
        natural sense of moral obligation or duty as truly as Butler or as
        Cudworth. And, indeed, a position very similar to this has been
        adopted by several intuitive moralists. Thus Hutcheson, who is the
        very founder in modern times of the doctrine of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a moral sense,”</span> and who has defended the
        disinterested character of virtue more powerfully than perhaps any
        other moralist, resolved all virtue into benevolence, or the pursuit
        of the happiness of others; but he maintained that the excellence and
        obligation of benevolence are revealed to us by a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“moral sense.”</span> Hume, in like manner, pronounced
        utility to be the criterion and essential element of all virtue, and
        is so far undoubtedly a Utilitarian; but he asserted also that our
        pursuit of virtue is unselfish, and that it springs from a natural
        feeling of approbation or disapprobation distinct from reason, and
        produced by a peculiar sense, or taste, which rises up within us at
        the contemplation of virtue or of vice.<a id="noteref_1" name=
        "noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a> A similar
        doctrine has more recently been advocated by Mackintosh. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It is supposed by many that it is a
        complete description of the Utilitarian system of morals, that it
        judges all actions and dispositions by their consequences,
        pronouncing them moral in proportion to their tendency to promote,
        immoral in proportion to their tendency to diminish, the happiness of
        man. But such a summary is clearly inadequate, for it deals only with
        one of the two questions which every moralist must answer. A theory
        of morals must explain not only what constitutes a duty, but also how
        we obtain the notion of there being such a thing as duty. It must
        tell us not merely what is the course of conduct we <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em> to
        pursue, but also what is the meaning of this word <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ought,”</span> and from what source we derive the idea
        it expresses.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who have
        undertaken to prove that all our morality is a product of experience,
        have not shrunk from this task, and have boldly entered upon the one
        path that was open to them. The notion of there being any such
        feeling as an original sense of obligation distinct from the
        anticipation of pleasure or pain, they treat as a mere illusion of
        the imagination. All that is meant by saying we ought to do an action
        is, that if we do not do it, we shall suffer. A desire to obtain
        happiness and to avoid pain is the only possible motive to action.
        The reason, and the only reason, why we should perform virtuous
        actions, or in other words, seek the good of others, is that on the
        whole such a course will bring us the greatest amount of
        happiness.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have here then
        a general statement of the doctrine which bases morals upon
        experience. If we ask what constitutes virtuous, and what vicious
        actions, we are told that the first are those which increase the
        happiness or diminish the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg
        006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        pains of mankind; and the second are those which have the opposite
        effect. If we ask what is the motive to virtue, we are told that it
        is an enlightened self-interest. The words happiness, utility, and
        interest include, however, many different kinds of enjoyment, and
        have given rise to many different modifications of the theory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Perhaps the lowest
        and most repulsive form of this theory is that which was propounded
        by Mandeville, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Enquiry into the
        Origin of Moral Virtue.”</span><a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2"
        href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> According
        to this writer, virtue sprang in the first instance from the cunning
        of rulers. These, in order to govern men, found it necessary to
        persuade them that it was a noble thing to restrain, instead of
        indulging their passions, and to devote themselves entirely to the
        good of the community. The manner in which they attained this end was
        by acting upon the feeling of vanity. They persuaded men that human
        nature was something nobler than the nature of animals, and that
        devotion to the community rendered a man pre-eminently great. By
        statues, and titles, and honours; by continually extolling such men
        as Regulus or Decius; by representing those who were addicted to
        useless enjoyments as a low and despicable class, they at last so
        inflamed the vanity of men as to kindle an intense emulation, and
        inspire <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name=
        "Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the most heroic
        actions. And soon new influences came into play. Men who began by
        restraining their passions, in order to acquire the pleasure of the
        esteem of others, found that this restraint saved them from many
        painful consequences that would have naturally ensued from
        over-indulgence, and this discovery became a new motive to virtue.
        Each member of the community moreover found that he himself derived
        benefit from the self-sacrifice of others, and also that when he was
        seeking his own interest, without regard to others, no persons stood
        so much in his way as those who were similarly employed, and he had
        thus a double reason for diffusing abroad the notion of the
        excellence of self-sacrifice. The result of all this was that men
        agreed to stigmatise under the term <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“vice”</span> whatever was injurious, and to eulogise as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“virtue”</span> whatever was beneficial to
        society.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The opinions of
        Mandeville attracted, when they were published, an attention greatly
        beyond their intrinsic merit, but they are now sinking rapidly into
        deserved oblivion. The author, in a poem called the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fable of the Bees,”</span> and in comments attached to
        it, himself advocated a thesis altogether inconsistent with that I
        have described, maintaining that <span class="tei tei-q">“private
        vices were public benefits,”</span> and endeavouring, in a long
        series of very feeble and sometimes very grotesque arguments, to
        prove that vice was in the highest degree beneficial to mankind. A
        far greater writer had however already framed a scheme of morals
        which, if somewhat less repulsive, was in no degree less selfish than
        that of Mandeville; and the opinions of Hobbes concerning the essence
        and origin of virtue, have, with no very great variations, been
        adopted by what may be termed the narrower school of
        Utilitarians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From such a
        conception of human nature it is easy to divine what system of morals
        must flow. No character, feeling, or action is naturally better than
        others, and as long as men are in a savage condition, morality has no
        existence. Fortunately, however, we are all dependent for many of our
        pleasures upon others. Co-operation and organisation are essential to
        our happiness, and these are impossible without <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> some restraint being placed upon our
        appetites. Laws are enacted to secure this restraint, and being
        sustained by rewards and punishments, they make it the interest of
        the individual to regard that of the community. According to Hobbes,
        the disposition of man is so anarchical, and the importance of
        restraining it so transcendent, that absolute government alone is
        good; the commands of the sovereign are supreme, and must therefore
        constitute the law of morals. The other moralists of the school,
        though repudiating this notion, have given a very great and
        distinguished place to legislation in their schemes of ethics; for
        all our conduct being determined by our interests, virtue being
        simply the conformity of our own interests with those of the
        community, and a judicious legislation being the chief way of
        securing this conformity, the functions of the moralist and of the
        legislator are almost identical.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13"

        addition to the rewards and punishments of the penal code, those
        arising from public opinion—fame or infamy, the friendship or
        hostility of those about us—are enlisted on the side of virtue. The
        educating influence of laws, and the growing perception of the
        identity of interests of the different members of the community,
        create a public opinion favourable to all the qualities which are

        religious motives; and as they maintain that every man necessarily
        pursues exclusively his own happiness, we return by another path to
        the old Platonic doctrine, that all vice is ignorance. Virtue is a
        judicious, and vice an injudicious, pursuit of pleasure. Virtue is a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far I have
        barely alluded to any but terrestrial motives. These, in the opinion
        of many of the most illustrious of the school, are sufficient, but
        others—as we shall see, I think, with great reason—are of a different
        opinion. Their obvious resource is in the rewards and punishments of
        another world, and these they accordingly present as the motive to
        virtue. Of all the modifications of the selfish theory, this alone
        can be said to furnish interested motives for virtue which are
        invariably and incontestably adequate. If men introduce the notion of
        infinite punishments and infinite rewards distributed by an
        omniscient Judge, they can undoubtedly supply stronger reasons for
        practising virtue than can ever be found for practising vice. While

        in the light of a prudential scheme, there are only two possible
        objections that could be brought against this theory. It might be
        said that the amount of virtue required for entering heaven was not
        defined, and that therefore it would be possible to enjoy some vices
        on earth with impunity. To this, however, it is answered that the
        very indefiniteness of the requirement renders zealous piety a matter
        of prudence, and also that there is probably a graduated scale of
        rewards and punishments adapted to every variety of merit and
        demerit.<a id="noteref_27" name="noteref_27" href=

        be said too that present pleasures are at least certain, and that

        transcendently great, that according to the rules of ordinary

        writers, however, some have diverged to a certain degree from the
        broad stream of utilitarianism, declaring that the foundation of the
        moral law is not utility, but the will or arbitrary decree of God.
        This opinion, which was propounded by the schoolman Ockham, and by
        several other writers of his age,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29"

        defended through a variety of motives. Some have upheld it on the
        philosophical ground that a law can be nothing but the sentence of a
        lawgiver; others from a desire to place morals in permanent
        subordination to theology; others in order to answer objections to
        Christianity derived from apparently immoral acts said to have been
        sanctioned by the Divinity; and others because having adopted strong
        Calvinistic sentiments, they were at once profoundly opposed to
        utilitarian morals, and at the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the majority of
        cases, however, these writers have proved substantially utilitarians.
        When asked how we can know the will of God, they answer that in as
        far as it is not included in express revelation, it must be
        discovered by the rule of utility; for nature proves that the Deity
        is supremely benevolent, and desires the welfare of men, and
        therefore any conduct that leads to that end is in conformity with
        His will.<a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href=

        question why the Divine will should be obeyed, there are but two
        answers. The first, which is that of the intuitive moralist, is that
        we are under a natural obligation of gratitude to our Creator. The
        second, which is that of the selfish moralist, is that the Creator
        has infinite rewards and punishments at His disposal. The latter
        answer appears usually to have been adopted, and the most eminent
        member has summed up with great succinctness the opinion of his
        school. <span class="tei tei-q">“The good of mankind,”</span> he
        says, <span class="tei tei-q">“is the subject, the will of God the
        rule, and everlasting happiness the motive and end of all
        virtue.”</span><a id="noteref_33" name="noteref_33" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        the distinctive characteristic of the inductive school of moralists
        is an absolute denial of the existence of any natural or innate moral
        sense or faculty enabling us to distinguish between the higher and
        lower parts of our nature, revealing to us either the existence of a
        law of duty or the conduct that it prescribes. We have seen that the
        only postulate of these writers is that happiness being universally
        desired is a desirable thing, that the only merit they recognise in
        actions or feelings is their tendency to promote human happiness, and
        that the only motive to a virtuous act they conceive possible is the
        real or supposed happiness of the agent. The sanctions of morality
        thus constitute its obligation, and apart from them the word
        <span class="tei tei-q">“ought”</span> is absolutely unmeaning. Those
        sanctions, as we have considered them, are of different kinds and
        degrees of magnitude. Paley, though elsewhere acknowledging the
        others, regarded the religious one as so immeasurably the first, that
        he represented it as the one motive of virtue.<a id="noteref_34"

        part of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the controversy in
        England between those who derived the moral code from experience, and
        those who derived it from intuitions of the reason, or from a special
        faculty, or from a moral sense, or from the power of sympathy, turned
        mainly upon the existence of an unselfish element in our nature. The
        reality of this existence having been maintained by Shaftesbury, was
        established with an unprecedented, and I believe an irresistible
        force, by Hutcheson, and the same question occupies a considerable
        place in the writings of Butler, Hume, and Adam Smith. The
        selfishness of the school of Hobbes, though in some degree mitigated,
        may be traced in every page of the writings of Bentham; but some of
        his disciples have in this respect deviated very widely from their
        master, and in their hands the whole tone and complexion of
        utilitarianism have been changed.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That human nature
        is so constituted that we naturally take a pleasure in the sight of
        the joy of others is one of those facts which to an ordinary observer
        might well appear among the most patent that can be conceived. We
        have seen, however, that it was emphatically denied by Hobbes, and
        during the greater part of the last century it was fashionable among
        writers of the school of Helvétius to endeavour to prove that all
        domestic or social affections were dictated simply by a need of the
        person who was beloved. The reality of the pleasures and pains of
        sympathy was admitted by Bentham;<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38"

        accordance with the whole spirit of his philosophy, he threw them as
        much as possible into the background, and, as I have already noticed,
        gave them no place in his summary of the sanctions of virtue. The
        tendency, however, of the later members of the school has been to
        recognise them fully,<a id="noteref_39" name="noteref_39" href=
        "#note_39"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> differ as to the
        source from which they spring. According to one section our
        benevolent affections are derived from our selfish feelings by an
        association of ideas in a manner which I shall presently describe.
        According to the other they are an original part of the constitution
        of our nature. However they be generated, their existence is
        admitted, their cultivation is a main object of morals, and the
        pleasure derived from their exercise a leading motive to virtue. The
        differences between the intuitive moralists and their rivals on this
        point are of two kinds. Both acknowledge the existence in human
        nature of both benevolent and malevolent feelings, and that we have a
        natural power of distinguishing one from the other; but the first
        maintain and the second deny that we have a natural power of
        perceiving that one is better than the other. Both admit that we
        enjoy a pleasure in acts of benevolence to others, but most writers
        of the first school maintain that that pleasure follows unsought for,
        while writers of the other school contend that the desire of
        obtaining it is the motive of the action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But by far the
        most ingenious and at the same time most influential system of
        utilitarian morals is that which owes its distinctive feature to the
        doctrine of association of Hartley. This doctrine, which among the
        modern achievements of ethics occupies on the utilitarian side a
        position corresponding in importance to the doctrine of innate moral
        faculties as distinguished from innate moral ideas on the intuitive
        side, was not absolutely unknown to the ancients, though they never
        perceived either the extent to which it may be carried or the
        important consequences that might be deduced from it. Some traces of
        it may be found in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg

        of the Epicureans applied it to friendship, maintaining that,
        although we first of all love our friend on account of the pleasure
        he can give us, we come soon to love him for his own sake, and apart
        from all considerations of utility.<a id="noteref_41" name=

        applied it only to some cases of apparently eccentric sympathies or
        antipathies. Hutcheson, however, closely anticipated both the
        doctrine of Hartley and the favourite illustration of the school;
        observing that we desire some things as themselves pleasurable and
        others only as means to obtain pleasurable things, and that these
        latter, which he terms <span class="tei tei-q">“secondary
        desires,”</span> may become as powerful as the former. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Thus, as soon as we come to apprehend the use of wealth
        or power to gratify any of our original desires we must also desire
        them. Hence arises the universality of these desires of wealth and
        power, since they are the means of gratifying all our
        desires.”</span><a id="noteref_43" name="noteref_43" href=
        "#note_43"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">43</span></span></a> The same
        principles were carried much farther by a clergyman named Gay in a
        short dissertation which is now almost forgotten, but to which
        Hartley ascribed the first suggestion of his theory,<a id=
        "noteref_44" name="noteref_44" href="#note_44"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">44</span></span></a> and in
        which indeed the most valuable part of it is clearly laid down.
        Differing altogether from Hutcheson as to the existence of any innate
        moral sense or principle <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg
        024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        benevolence in man, Gay admitted that the arguments of Hutcheson to
        prove that the adult man possesses a moral sense were irresistible,
        and he attempted to reconcile this fact with the teaching of Locke by
        the doctrine of <span class="tei tei-q">“secondary desires.”</span>
        He remarks that in our reasonings we do not always fall back upon
        first principles or axioms, but sometimes start from propositions
        which though not self-evident we know to be capable of proof. In the
        same way in justifying our actions we do not always appeal to the
        tendency to produce happiness which is their one ultimate
        justification, but content ourselves by showing that they produce
        some of the known <span class="tei tei-q">“means to
        happiness.”</span> These <span class="tei tei-q">“means to
        happiness”</span> being continually appealed to as justifying motives
        come insensibly to be regarded as ends, possessing an intrinsic value
        irrespective of their tendency; and in this manner it is that we love
        and admire virtue even when unconnected with our interests.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great work of
        Hartley expanding and elaborating these views was published in 1747.
        It was encumbered by much physiological speculation into which it is
        needless for us now to enter, about the manner in which emotions act
        upon the nerves, and although accepted enthusiastically by Priestley
        and Belsham, and in some degree by Tucker, I do not think that its
        purely ethical speculations had much influence until they were
        adopted by some leading utilitarians in the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> Whatever
        may be thought of the truth, it is impossible to withhold some
        admiration from the intellectual grandeur of a system which starting
        from a conception of human nature as low and as base as that of
        Mandeville or Hobbes professes without the introduction of a single
        new or nobler element, by a strange process of philosophic alchemy,
        to evolve out of this original selfishness the most heroic and most
        sensitive virtue. The manner in which this achievement is effected is
        commonly illustrated by the passion of avarice. Money in itself
        possesses absolutely nothing that is admirable or pleasurable, but
        being the means of procuring us many of the objects of our desire, it
        becomes associated in our minds with the idea of pleasure; it is
        therefore itself loved; and it is possible for the love of money so
        completely to eclipse or supersede the love of all those things which
        money procures, that the miser will forego them all, rather than part
        with a fraction of his gold.<a id="noteref_47" name="noteref_47"
        href="#note_47"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
        phenomenon may be traced, it is said, in a multitude of other
        forms.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href=
        "#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">48</span></span></a> Thus we
        seek power, because it gives us the means of gratifying many desires.
        It becomes associated with those desires, and is, at last, itself
        passionately loved. Praise indicates the affection of the eulogist,
        and marks us out for the affection of others. Valued at first as a
        means, it is soon desired as an end, and to such a pitch can our
        enthusiasm rise, that we may sacrifice all earthly things for
        posthumous praise which can never reach our ear. And the force of
        association may extend even farther. We love praise, because it
        procures us certain advantages. We then love it more than these
        advantages. We proceed by the same process to transfer our affections
        to those things which naturally or generally procure praise. We at
        last love what is praiseworthy more than praise, and will endure
        perpetual obloquy rather than abandon it.<a id="noteref_49" name=
        "noteref_49" href="#note_49"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">49</span></span></a> To this
        process, it is said, all our moral sentiments must be ascribed. Man
        has no natural benevolent feelings. He is at first governed solely by
        his interest, but the infant learns to associate its pleasures with
        the idea of its mother, the boy with the idea of his family, the man
        with those of his class, his church, his country, and at last of all
        mankind, and in each case an independent affection is at length
        formed.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
        "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a> The
        sight of suffering in others awakens in the child a painful
        recollection of his own sufferings, which parents, by appealing to
        the infant imagination, still further strengthen, and besides,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“when several children are educated together,
        the pains, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page027">[pg
        027]</span><a name="Pg027" id="Pg027" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        denials of pleasure, and the sorrows which affect one gradually
        extend in some degree to all;”</span> and thus the suffering of
        others becomes associated with the idea of our own, and the feeling
        of compassion is engendered.<a id="noteref_51" name="noteref_51"
        href="#note_51"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a>
        Benevolence and justice are associated in our minds with the esteem
        of our fellow-men, with reciprocity of favours, and with the hope of
        future reward. They are loved at first for these, and finally for
        themselves, while opposite trains of association produce opposite
        feelings towards malevolence and injustice.<a id="noteref_52" name=
        "noteref_52" href="#note_52"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> And thus
        virtue, considered as a whole, becomes the supreme object of our
        affections. Of all our pleasures, more are derived from those acts
        which are called virtuous, than from any other source. The virtuous
        acts of others procure us countless advantages. Our own virtue
        obtains for us the esteem of men and return of favours. All the
        epithets of praise are appropriated to virtue, and all the epithets
        of blame to vice. Religion teaches us to connect hopes of infinite
        joy with the one, and fears of infinite suffering with the other.
        Virtue becomes therefore peculiarly associated with the idea of
        pleasurable things. It is soon loved, independently of and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028"
        id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> more than these; we feel a
        glow of pleasure in practising it, and an intense pain in violating
        it. Conscience, which is thus generated, becomes the ruling principle
        of our lives,<a id="noteref_53" name="noteref_53" href=
        "#note_53"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">53</span></span></a> and
        having learnt to sacrifice all earthly things rather than disobey it,
        we rise, by an association of ideas, into the loftiest region of
        heroism.<a id="noteref_54" name="noteref_54" href=
        "#note_54"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The influence of
        this ingenious, though I think in some respect fanciful, theory
        depends less upon the number than upon the ability of its adherents.
        Though little known, I believe, beyond England, it has in England
        exercised a great fascination over exceedingly dissimilar
        minds,<a id="noteref_55" name="noteref_55" href=
        "#note_55"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> and it
        does undoubtedly evade some of the objections to the other forms of
        the inductive theory. Thus, when intuitive moralists contend that our
        moral judgments, being instantaneous and effected under the manifest
        impulse of an emotion of sympathy or repulsion, are as far as
        possible removed from that cold calculation of interests to which the
        utilitarian reduces them, it is answered, that the association of
        ideas is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page029">[pg
        029]</span><a name="Pg029" id="Pg029" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        sufficient to engender a feeling which is the proximate cause of our
        decision.<a id="noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href=
        "#note_56"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> Alone,
        of all the moralists of this school, the disciple of Hartley
        recognises conscience as a real and important element of our
        nature,<a id="noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href=
        "#note_57"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> and
        maintains that it is possible to love virtue for itself as a form of
        happiness without any thought of ulterior consequences.<a id=
        "noteref_58" name="noteref_58" href="#note_58"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">58</span></span></a> The
        immense value this theory ascribes to education, gives it an unusual
        practical importance. When we are balancing between a crime and a
        virtue, our wills, it is said, are necessarily determined by the
        greater pleasure. If we find more pleasure in the vice than in the
        virtue, we inevitably gravitate to evil. If we find more pleasure in
        the virtue than in the vice, we are as irresistibly attracted towards
        good. But the strength of such motives may be immeasurably enhanced
        by an early association of ideas. If we have been accustomed from
        childhood to associate our ideas of praise and pleasure with
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page030">[pg 030]</span><a name="Pg030"
        id="Pg030" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> virtue, we shall readily yield
        to virtuous motives; if with vice, to vicious ones. This readiness to
        yield to one or other set of motives, constitutes disposition, which
        is thus, according to these moralists, altogether an artificial
        thing, the product of education, and effected by association of
        ideas.<a id="noteref_59" name="noteref_59" href=
        "#note_59"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">59</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
        observed, however, that this theory, refined and imposing as it may
        appear, is still essentially a selfish one. Even when sacrificing all
        earthly objects through love of virtue, the good man is simply
        seeking his greatest enjoyment, indulging a kind of mental luxury
        which gives him more pleasure than what he foregoes, just as the
        miser finds more pleasure in accumulation than in any form of
        expenditure.<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href=
        "#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> There
        has been, indeed, one attempt to emancipate the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page031">[pg 031]</span><a name="Pg031" id="Pg031"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> theory from this condition, but it
        appears to me altogether futile. It has been said that men in the
        first instance indulge in baneful excesses, on account of the
        pleasure they afford, but the habit being contracted, continue to
        practise them after they have ceased to afford pleasure, and that a
        similar law may operate in the case of the habit of virtue.<a id=
        "noteref_61" name="noteref_61" href="#note_61"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">61</span></span></a> But the
        reason why men who have contracted a habit continue to practise it
        after it has ceased to give them positive enjoyment, is because to
        desist, creates a restlessness and uneasiness which amounts to acute
        mental pain. To avoid that pain is the motive of the action.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader who has
        perused the passages I have accumulated in the notes, will be able to
        judge with what degree of justice utilitarian writers denounce with
        indignation the imputation of selfishness, as a calumny against their
        system. It is not, I think, a strained or unnatural use of language
        to describe as selfish or interested, all actions which a man
        performs, in order himself to avoid suffering or acquire the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page032">[pg 032]</span><a name="Pg032"
        id="Pg032" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> greatest possible enjoyment.
        If this be so, the term selfish is strictly applicable to all the
        branches of this system.<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href=
        "#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a> At the
        same time it must be acknowledged that there is a broad difference
        between the refined hedonism of the utilitarians we have last
        noticed, and the writings of Hobbes, of Mandeville, or of Paley. It
        must be acknowledged, also, that not a few intuitive or stoical
        moralists have spoken of the pleasure to be derived from virtue in
        language little if at all different from these writers.<a id=
        "noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class=

        object of the earlier members of the inductive school, was to depress
        human nature to their standard, by resolving all the noblest actions
        into coarse and selfish elements. The main object of some of the more
        influential of the later members of this school, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page033">[pg 033]</span><a name="Pg033" id="Pg033"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has been to sublimate their conceptions
        of happiness and interest in such a manner, as to include the highest
        displays of heroism. As we have seen, they fully admit that
        conscience is a real thing, and should be the supreme guide of our
        lives, though they contend that it springs originally from
        selfishness, transformed under the influence of the association of
        ideas. They acknowledge the reality of the sympathetic feelings,
        though they usually trace them to the same source. They cannot, it is
        true, consistently with their principles, recognise the possibility
        of conduct which is in the strictest sense of the word unselfish, but
        they contend that it is quite possible for a man to find his highest
        pleasure in sacrificing himself for the good of others, that the
        association of virtue and pleasure is only perfect when it leads
        habitually to spontaneous and uncalculating action, and that no man
        is in a healthy moral condition who does not find more pain in
        committing a crime than he could derive pleasure from any of its
        consequences. The theory in its principle remains unchanged, but in
        the hands of some of these writers the spirit has wholly altered.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus given
        a brief, but, I trust, clear and faithful account of the different
        modifications of the inductive theory, I shall proceed to state some
        of the principal objections that have been and may be brought against
        it. I shall then endeavour to define and defend the opinions of those
        who believe that our moral feelings are an essential part of our
        constitution, developed by, but not derived from education, and I
        shall conclude this chapter by an enquiry into the order of their
        evolution; so that having obtained some notion of the natural history
        of morals, we may be able, in the ensuing chapters, to judge, how far
        their normal progress has been accelerated or retarded by religious
        or political agencies.</p>

        moralists assert, that what we call virtue derives its reputation

        agent is the one motive to practise it, our first question is
        naturally how far this theory agrees with the feelings and with the
        language of mankind. But if tested by this criterion, there never was
        a doctrine more emphatically condemned than utilitarianism. In all
        its stages, and in all its assertions, it is in direct opposition to
        common language and to common sentiments. In all nations and in all
        ages, the ideas of interest and utility on the one hand and of virtue
        on the other, have been regarded by the multitude as perfectly
        distinct, and all languages recognise the distinction. The terms
        honour, justice, rectitude or virtue, and their equivalents in every
        language, present to the mind ideas essentially and broadly differing
        from the terms prudence, sagacity, or interest. The two lines of
        conduct may coincide, but they are never confused, and we have not
        the slightest difficulty in imagining them antagonistic. When we say
        a man is governed by a high sense of honour, or by strong moral
        feeling, we do not mean that he is prudently pursuing either his own
        interests or the interests of society. The universal sentiment of
        mankind represents self-sacrifice as an essential element of a
        meritorious act, and means by self-sacrifice the deliberate adoption
        of the least pleasurable course without the prospect of any pleasure
        in return. A selfish act may be innocent, but cannot be virtuous, and
        to ascribe all good deeds to selfish motives, is not the distortion
        but the negation of virtue. No Epicurean could avow before a popular
        audience that the one end of his life was the pursuit of his own
        happiness without an outburst of indignation and contempt.<a id=
        "noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a> No man
        could consciously make this—which according to the selfish theory is
        the only rational and indeed possible motive of action—the deliberate
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035"
        id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> object of all his
        undertakings, without his character becoming despicable and degraded.
        Whether we look within ourselves or examine the conduct either of our
        enemies or of our friends, or adjudicate upon the characters in
        history or in fiction, our feelings on these matters are the same. In
        exact proportion as we believe a desire for personal enjoyment to be
        the motive of a good act is the merit of the agent diminished. If we
        believe the motive to be wholly selfish the merit is altogether
        destroyed. If we believe it to be wholly disinterested the merit is
        altogether unalloyed. Hence, the admiration bestowed upon Prometheus,
        or suffering virtue constant beneath the blows of Almighty malice, or
        on the atheist who with no prospect of future reward suffered a
        fearful death, rather than abjure an opinion which could be of no
        benefit to society, because he believed it to be the truth. Selfish
        moralists deny the possibility of that which all ages, all nations,
        all popular judgments pronounce to have been the characteristic of
        every noble act that has ever been performed. Now, when a philosophy
        which seeks by the light of consciousness to decipher the laws of our
        moral being proves so diametrically opposed to the conclusions
        arrived at by the great mass of mankind, who merely follow their
        consciousness without endeavouring to frame systems of philosophy,
        that it makes most of the distinctions of common ethical language
        absolutely unmeaning, this is, to say the least, a strong presumption
        against its truth. If Molière's hero had been speaking prose all his
        life without knowing it, this was simply because he did not
        understand what prose was. In the present case we are asked to
        believe that men have been under a total delusion about the leading
        principles of their lives which they had distinguished by a whole
        vocabulary of terms.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is said that
        the case becomes different when the pleasure sought is not a gross or
        material enjoyment, but the satisfaction of performed virtue. I
        suspect that if men <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg
        036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        could persuade themselves that the one motive of a virtuous man was
        the certainty that the act he accomplished would be followed by a
        glow of satisfaction so intense as more than to compensate for any
        sacrifice he might have made, the difference would not be as great as
        is supposed. In fact, however—and the consciousness of this lies, I
        conceive, at the root of the opinions of men upon the subject—the
        pleasure of virtue is one which can only be obtained on the express
        condition of its not being the object sought. Phenomena of this kind
        are familiar to us all. Thus, for example, it has often been observed
        that prayer, by a law of our nature and apart from all supernatural
        intervention, exercises a reflex influence of a very beneficial
        character upon the minds of the worshippers. The man who offers up
        his petitions with passionate earnestness, with unfaltering faith,
        and with a vivid realisation of the presence of an Unseen Being has
        risen to a condition of mind which is itself eminently favourable
        both to his own happiness and to the expansion of his moral
        qualities. But he who expects nothing more will never attain this. To
        him who neither believes nor hopes that his petitions will receive a
        response such a mental state is impossible. No Protestant before an
        image of the Virgin, no Christian before a pagan idol, could possibly
        attain it. If prayers were offered up solely with a view to this
        benefit, they would be absolutely sterile and would speedily cease.
        Thus again, certain political economists have contended that to give
        money in charity is worse than useless, that it is positively noxious
        to society, but they have added that the gratification of our
        benevolent affections is pleasing to ourselves, and that the pleasure
        we derive from this source may be so much greater than the evil
        resulting from our gift, that we may justly, according to the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“greatest happiness principle,”</span>
        purchase this large amount of gratification to ourselves by a slight
        injury to our neighbours. The political economy involved in this very
        characteristic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg
        037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        specimen of utilitarian ethics I shall hereafter examine. At present
        it is sufficient to observe that no one who consciously practised
        benevolence solely from this motive could obtain the pleasure in
        question. We receive enjoyment from the thought that we have done
        good. We never could receive that enjoyment if we believed and
        realised that we were doing harm. The same thing is pre-eminently
        true of the satisfaction of conscience. A feeling of satisfaction
        follows the accomplishment of duty for itself, but if the duty be
        performed solely through the expectation of a mental pleasure
        conscience refuses to ratify the bargain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no fact
        more conspicuous in human nature than the broad distinction, both in
        kind and degree, drawn between the moral and the other parts of our
        nature. But this on utilitarian principles is altogether
        unaccountable. If the excellence of virtue consists solely in its
        utility or tendency to promote the happiness of men, we should be
        compelled to canonise a crowd of acts which are utterly remote from
        all our ordinary notions of morality. The whole tendency of political
        economy and philosophical history which reveal the physiology of
        societies, is to show that the happiness and welfare of mankind are
        evolved much more from our selfish than from what are termed our
        virtuous acts. The prosperity of nations and the progress of
        civilisation are mainly due to the exertions of men who while
        pursuing strictly their own interests, were unconsciously promoting
        the interests of the community. The selfish instinct that leads men
        to accumulate, confers ultimately more advantage upon the world than
        the generous instinct that leads men to give. A great historian has
        contended with some force that intellectual development is more
        important to societies than moral development. Yet who ever seriously
        questioned the reality of the distinction that separates these
        things? The reader will probably exclaim that the key to that
        distinction is to be found in the motive; but it is one of the
        paradoxes of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg
        038]</span><a name="Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        utilitarian school that the motive of the agent has absolutely no
        influence on the morality of the act. According to Bentham, there is
        but one motive possible, the pursuit of our own enjoyment. The most
        virtuous, the most vicious, and the most indifferent of actions, if
        measured by this test, would be exactly the same, and an
        investigation of motives should therefore be altogether excluded from
        our moral judgments.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href=
        "#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> Whatever
        test we adopt, the difficulty of accounting for the unique and
        pre-eminent position mankind have assigned to virtue will remain. If
        we judge by tendencies, a crowd of objects and of acts to which no
        mortal ever dreamed of ascribing virtue, contribute largely to the
        happiness of man. If we judge by motives, the moralists we are
        reviewing have denied all generic difference between prudential and
        virtuous <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page039">[pg
        039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        motives. If we judge by intentions, it is certain that however much
        truth or chastity may contribute to the happiness of mankind, it is
        not with philanthropic intentions that those virtues are
        cultivated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is often said
        that intuitive moralists in their reasonings are guilty of
        continually abandoning their principles by themselves appealing to
        the tendency of certain acts to promote human happiness as a
        justification, and the charge is usually accompanied by a challenge
        to show any confessed virtue that has not that tendency. To the first
        objection it may be shortly answered that no intuitive moralist ever
        dreamed of doubting that benevolence or charity, or in other words,
        the promotion of the happiness of man, is a duty. He maintains that
        it not only is so, but that we arrive at this fact by direct
        intuition, and not by the discovery that such a course is conducive
        to our own interest. But while he cordially recognises this branch of
        virtue, and while he has therefore a perfect right to allege the
        beneficial effects of a virtue in its defence, he refuses to admit
        that all virtue can be reduced to this single principle. With the
        general sentiment of mankind he regards charity as a good thing only
        because it is of use to the world. With the same general sentiment of
        mankind he believes that chastity and truth have an independent
        value, distinct from their influence upon happiness. To the question
        whether every confessed virtue is conducive to human happiness, it is
        less easy to reply, for it is usually extremely difficult to
        calculate the remote tendencies of acts, and in cases where, in the
        common apprehension of mankind, the morality is very clear, the
        consequences are often very obscure. Notwithstanding the claim of
        great precision which utilitarian writers so boastfully make, the
        standard by which they profess to measure morals is itself absolutely
        incapable of definition or accurate explanation. Happiness is one of
        the most indeterminate and undefinable words in the language, and
        what are the conditions of <span class="tei tei-q">“the greatest
        possible happiness”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page040">[pg
        040]</span><a name="Pg040" id="Pg040" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> no
        one can precisely say. No two nations, perhaps no two individuals,
        would find them the same.<a id="noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href=
        "#note_67"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">67</span></span></a> And even
        if every virtuous act were incontestably useful, it by no means
        follows that its virtue is derived from its utility.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be readily
        granted, that as a general rule those acts which we call virtuous,
        are unquestionably productive of happiness, if not to the agent, at
        least to mankind in general, but we have already seen that they have
        by no means that monopoly or pre-eminence of utility which on
        utilitarian principles, the unique position assigned to them would
        appear to imply. It may be added, that if we were to proceed in
        detail to estimate acts by their consequences, we should soon be led
        to very startling conclusions. In the first place, it is obvious that
        if virtues are only good because they promote, and vices only evil
        because they impair the happiness of mankind, the degrees of
        excellence or criminality must be strictly proportioned to the
        degrees of utility or the reverse.<a id="noteref_68" name=
        "noteref_68" href="#note_68"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">68</span></span></a> Every
        action, every disposition, every class, every condition of society
        must take its place on the moral scale precisely in accordance with
        the degree in which it promotes or diminishes human happiness. Now it
        is extremely questionable, whether some of the most monstrous forms
        of sensuality which it is scarcely possible to name, cause as much
        unhappiness as some infirmities of temper, or procrastination or
        hastiness of judgment. It is scarcely doubtful that a modest,
        diffident, and retiring nature, distrustful of its own abilities, and
        shrinking with humility from conflict, produces on the whole less
        benefit to the world than the self-assertion of an audacious and
        arrogant nature, which is impelled to every struggle, and developes
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041"
        id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> every capacity. Gratitude has
        no doubt done much to soften and sweeten the intercourse of life, but
        the corresponding feeling of revenge was for centuries the one
        bulwark against social anarchy, and is even now one of the chief
        restraints to crime.<a id="noteref_69" name="noteref_69" href=
        "#note_69"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">69</span></span></a> On the
        great theatre of public life, especially in periods of great
        convulsions when passions are fiercely roused, it is neither the man
        of delicate scrupulosity and sincere impartiality, nor yet the
        single-minded religious enthusiast, incapable of dissimulation or
        procrastination, who confers most benefit upon the world. It is much
        rather the astute statesman earnest about his ends but unscrupulous
        about his means, equally free from the trammels of conscience and
        from the blindness of zeal, who governs because he partly yields to
        the passions and the prejudices of his time. But however much some
        modern writers may idolize the heroes of success, however much they
        may despise and ridicule those far nobler men, whose wide tolerance
        and scrupulous honour <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
        042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        rendered them unfit leaders in the fray, it has scarcely yet been
        contended that the delicate conscientiousness which in these cases
        impairs utility constitutes vice. If utility is the sole measure of
        virtue, it is difficult to understand how we could look with moral
        disapprobation on any class who prevent greater evils than they
        cause. But with such a principle we might find strange priestesses at
        the utilitarian shrine. <span class="tei tei-q">“Aufer meretrices de
        rebus humanis,”</span> said St. Augustine, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“turbaveris omnia libidinibus.”</span><a id="noteref_70"
        name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us suppose an
        enquirer who intended to regulate his life consistently by the
        utilitarian principle; let us suppose him to have overcome the first
        great difficulty of his school, arising from the apparent divergence
        of his own interests from his duty, to have convinced himself that
        that divergence does not exist, and to have accordingly made the
        pursuit of duty his single object, it remains to consider what kind
        of course he would pursue. He is informed that it is a pure illusion
        to suppose that human actions have any other end or rule than
        happiness, that nothing is intrinsically good or intrinsically bad
        apart from its consequences, that no act which is useful can possibly
        be vicious, and that the utility of an act constitutes and measures
        its value. One of his first observations will be that in very many
        special cases acts such as murder, theft, or falsehood, which the
        world calls criminal, and which in the majority of instances would
        undoubtedly be hurtful, appear eminently productive of good. Why
        then, he may ask, should they not in these cases be performed? The
        answer he receives is that they would not really be useful, because
        we must consider the remote as well as the immediate consequences of
        actions, and although in particular instances a falsehood or even a
        murder might appear beneficial, it is one of the most important
        interests of mankind <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg
        043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        that the sanctity of life and property should be preserved, and that
        a high standard of veracity should be maintained. But this answer is
        obviously insufficient. It is necessary to show that the extent to
        which a single act of what the world calls crime would weaken these
        great bulwarks of society is such as to counterbalance the immediate
        good which it produces. If it does not, the balance will be on the
        side of happiness, the murder or theft or falsehood will be useful,
        and therefore, on utilitarian principles, will be virtuous. Now even
        in the case of public acts, the effect of the example of an obscure
        individual is usually small, but if the act be accomplished in
        perfect secrecy, the evil effects resulting from the example will be
        entirely absent. It has been said that it would be dangerous to give
        men permission to perpetrate what men call crimes in secret. This may
        be a very good reason why the utilitarian should not proclaim such a
        principle, but it is no reason why he should not act upon it. If a
        man be convinced that no act which is useful can possibly be
        criminal, if it be in his power by perpetrating what is called a
        crime to obtain an end of great immediate utility, and if he is able
        to secure such absolute secrecy as to render it perfectly certain
        that his act cannot become an example, and cannot in consequence
        exercise any influence on the general standard of morals, it appears
        demonstrably certain that on utilitarian principles he would be
        justified in performing it. If what we call virtue be only virtuous
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">because</span></em> it is useful, it can only be
        virtuous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">when</span></em> it is useful. The question of
        the morality of a large number of acts must therefore depend upon the
        probability of their detection,<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71"

        id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and a little adroit hypocrisy
        must often, not merely in appearance but in reality, convert a vice
        into a virtue. The only way by which it has been attempted with any
        plausibility to evade this conclusion has been by asserting that the
        act would impair the disposition of the agent, or in other words
        predispose him on other occasions to perform acts which are generally
        hurtful to society. But in the first place a single act has no such
        effect upon disposition as to counteract a great immediate good,
        especially when, as we have supposed, that act is not a revolt
        against what is believed to be right, but is performed under the full
        belief that it is in accordance with the one rational rule of morals,
        and in the next place, as far as the act would form a habit it would
        appear to be the habit of in all cases regulating actions by a
        precise and minute calculation of their utility, which is the very
        ideal of utilitarian virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If our enquirer
        happens to be a man of strong imagination and of solitary habits, it
        is very probable that he will be accustomed to live much in a world
        of imagination, a world peopled with beings that are to him as real
        as those of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg
        045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        flesh, with its joys and sorrows, its temptations and its sins. In
        obedience to the common feelings of our nature he may have struggled
        long and painfully against sins of the imagination, which he was
        never seriously tempted to convert into sins of action. But his new
        philosophy will be admirably fitted to console his mind. If remorse
        be absent the indulgence of the most vicious imagination is a
        pleasure, and if this indulgence does not lead to action it is a
        clear gain, and therefore to be applauded. That a course may be
        continually pursued in imagination without leading to corresponding
        actions he will speedily discover, and indeed it has always been one
        of the chief objections brought against fiction that the constant
        exercise of the sympathies in favour of imaginary beings is found
        positively to indispose men to practical benevolence.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Proceeding farther
        in his course, our moralist will soon find reason to qualify the
        doctrine of remote consequences, which plays so large a part in the
        calculations of utilitarianism. It is said that it is criminal to
        destroy human beings, even when the crime would appear productive of
        great utility, for every instance of murder weakens the sanctity of
        life. But experience shows that it is possible for men to be
        perfectly indifferent to one particular section of human life,
        without this indifference extending to others. Thus among the ancient
        Greeks, the murder or exposition of the children of poor parents was
        continually practised with the most absolute callousness, without
        exercising any appreciable influence upon the respect for adult life.
        In the same manner what may be termed religious unveracity, or the
        habit of propagating what are deemed useful superstitions, with the
        consciousness of their being false, or at least suppressing or
        misrepresenting the facts that might invalidate <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them, does not in any degree imply
        industrial unveracity. Nothing is more common than to find extreme
        dishonesty in speculation coexisting with scrupulous veracity in
        business. If any vice might be expected to conform strictly to the
        utilitarian theory, it would be cruelty; but cruelty to animals may
        exist without leading to cruelty to men, and even where spectacles in
        which animal suffering forms a leading element exercise an injurious
        influence on character, it is more than doubtful whether the measure
        of human unhappiness they may ultimately produce is at all equivalent
        to the passionate enjoyment they immediately afford.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last
        consideration, however, makes it necessary to notice a new, and as it
        appears to me, almost grotesque development of the utilitarian
        theory. The duty of humanity to animals, though for a long period too
        much neglected, may, on the principles of the intuitive moralist, be
        easily explained and justified. Our circumstances and characters
        produce in us many and various affections towards all with whom we
        come in contact, and our consciences pronounce these affections to be
        good or bad. We feel that humanity or benevolence is a good
        affection, and also that it is due in different degrees to different
        classes. Thus it is not only natural but right that a man should care
        for his own family more than for the world at large, and this
        obligation applies not only to parents who are responsible for having
        brought their children into existence, and to children who owe a debt
        of gratitude to their parents, but also to brothers who have no such
        special tie. So too we feel it to be both unnatural and wrong to feel
        no stronger interest in our fellow-countrymen than in other men. In
        the same way we feel that there is a wide interval between the
        humanity it is both natural and right to exhibit towards animals, and
        that which is due to our own species. Strong philanthropy could
        hardly coexist with cannibalism, and a man who had no hesitation in
        destroying human life for the sake of obtaining the skins
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047"
        id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the victims, or of freeing
        himself from some trifling inconvenience, would scarcely be eulogised
        for his benevolence. Yet a man may be regarded as very humane to
        animals who has no scruple in sacrificing their lives for his food,
        his pleasures, or his convenience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Towards the close
        of the last century an energetic agitation in favour of humanity to
        animals arose in England, and the utilitarian moralists, who were
        then rising into influence, caught the spirit of their time and made
        very creditable efforts to extend it.<a id="noteref_73" name=
        "noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> It is
        manifest, however, that a theory which recognised no other end in
        virtue than the promotion of human happiness, could supply no
        adequate basis for the movement. Some of the recent members of the
        school have accordingly enlarged their theory, maintaining that acts
        are virtuous when they produce a net result of happiness, and vicious
        when they produce a net result of suffering, altogether irrespective
        of the question whether this enjoyment or suffering is of men or
        animals. In other words, they place the duty of man to animals on
        exactly the same basis as the duty of man to his fellow-men,
        maintaining that no suffering can be rightly inflicted on brutes,
        which does not produce a larger amount of happiness to man.<a id=
        "noteref_74" name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">74</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
        reflection suggested by this theory is, that it <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> appears difficult to understand how, on
        the principles of the inductive school, it could be arrived at.
        Benevolence, as we have seen, according to these writers begins in
        interest. We first of all do good to men, because it is for our
        advantage, though the force of the habit may at last act irrespective
        of interest. But in the case of animals which cannot resent
        barbarity, this foundation of self-interest does not for the most
        part<a id="noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> exist.
        Probably, however, an association of ideas might help to solve the
        difficulty, and the habit of benevolence generated originally from
        the social relations of men might at last be extended to the animal
        world; but that it should be so to the extent of placing the duty to
        animals on the same basis as the duty to men, I do not anticipate, or
        (at the risk of being accused of great inhumanity), I must add,
        desire. I cannot look forward to a time when no one will wear any
        article of dress formed out of the skin of an animal, or feed upon
        animal flesh, till he has ascertained that the pleasure he derives
        from doing so, exceeds the pain inflicted upon the animal, as well as
        the pleasure of which by abridging its life he has deprived it.<a id=
        "noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> And
        supposing that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg
        049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        with such a calculation before him, the utilitarian should continue
        to feed on the flesh of animals, his principle might carry him to
        further conclusions, from which I confess I should recoil. If, when
        Swift was writing his famous essay in favour of employing for food
        the redundant babies of a half-starving population, he had been
        informed that, according to the more advanced moralists, to eat a
        child, and to eat a sheep, rest upon exactly the same ground; that in
        the one case as in the other, the single question for the moralist
        is, whether the repast on the whole produces more pleasure than pain,
        it must be owned that the discovery would have greatly facilitated
        his task.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The considerations
        I have adduced will, I think, be sufficient to show that the
        utilitarian principle if pushed to its full logical consequences
        would be by no means as accordant with ordinary moral notions as is
        sometimes alleged; that it would, on the contrary, lead to
        conclusions utterly and outrageously repugnant to the moral feelings
        it is intended to explain. I will conclude this part of my argument
        by very briefly adverting to two great fields in which, as I believe,
        it would prove especially revolutionary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first of these
        is the field of chastity. It will be necessary for me in the course
        of the present work to dwell at greater length than I should desire
        upon questions connected with this virtue. At present, I will merely
        ask the reader to conceive a mind from which all notion of the
        intrinsic excellence or nobility of purity was banished, and to
        suppose such a mind comparing, by a utilitarian standard, a period in
        which sensuality was almost unbridled, such as the age of Athenian
        glory or the English restoration, with a period of austere virtue.
        The question which of these societies was morally the best would thus
        resolve itself solely into the question in which there was produced
        the greatest amount of enjoyment and the smallest amount of
        suffering. The pleasures of domestic life, the pleasures resulting
        from a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name=
        "Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> freer social
        intercourse,<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77" href=
        "#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> the
        different degrees of suffering inflicted on those who violated the
        law of chastity, the ulterior consequences of each mode of life upon
        well-being and upon population, would be the chief elements of the
        comparison. Can any one believe that the balance of enjoyment would
        be so unquestionably and so largely on the side of the more austere
        society as to justify the degree of superiority which is assigned to
        it?<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href="#note_78"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">78</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second sphere
        is that of speculative truth. No class of men have more highly valued
        an unflinching hostility to superstition than utilitarians. Yet it is
        more than doubtful whether upon their principles it can be justified.
        Many superstitions do undoubtedly answer to the Greek conception
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051"
        id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of slavish <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“fear of the gods,”</span> and have been productive of
        unspeakable misery to mankind, but there are very many others of a
        different tendency. Superstitions appeal to our hopes as well as to
        our fears. They often meet and gratify the inmost longings of the
        heart. They offer certainties when reason can only afford
        possibilities or probabilities. They supply conceptions on which the
        imagination loves to dwell. They sometimes even impart a new sanction
        to moral truths. Creating wants which they alone can satisfy, and
        fears which they alone can quell, they often become essential
        elements of happiness, and their consoling efficacy is most felt in
        the languid or troubled hours when it is most needed. We owe more to
        our illusions than to our knowledge. The imagination, which is
        altogether constructive, probably contributes more to our happiness
        than the reason, which in the sphere of speculation is mainly
        critical and destructive. The rude charm which in the hour of danger
        or distress the savage clasps so confidently to his breast, the
        sacred picture which is believed to shed a hallowing and protecting
        influence over the poor man's cottage, can bestow a more real
        consolation in the darkest hour of human suffering than can be
        afforded by the grandest theories of philosophy. The first desire of
        the heart is to find something on which to lean. Happiness is a
        condition of feeling, not a condition of circumstances, and to common
        minds one of its first essentials is the exclusion of painful and
        harassing doubt. A system of belief may be false, superstitious, and
        reactionary, and may yet be conducive to human happiness if it
        furnishes great multitudes of men with what they believe to be a key
        to the universe, if it consoles them in those seasons of agonizing
        bereavement when the consolations of enlightened reason are but empty
        words, if it supports their feeble and tottering minds in the gloomy
        hours of sickness and of approaching death. A credulous and
        superstitious nature may be degraded, but in the many cases where
        superstition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg
        052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        does not assume a persecuting or appalling form it is not unhappy,
        and degradation, apart from unhappiness, can have no place in
        utilitarian ethics. No error can be more grave than to imagine that
        when a critical spirit is abroad the pleasant beliefs will all
        remain, and the painful ones alone will perish. To introduce into the
        mind the consciousness of ignorance and the pangs of doubt is to
        inflict or endure much suffering, which may even survive the period
        of transition. <span class="tei tei-q">“Why is it,”</span> said
        Luther's wife, looking sadly back upon the sensuous creed which she
        had left, <span class="tei tei-q">“that in our old faith we prayed so
        often and so warmly, and that our prayers are now so few and so
        cold?”</span><a id="noteref_79" name="noteref_79" href=
        "#note_79"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">79</span></span></a> It is
        related of an old monk named Serapion, who had embraced the heresy of
        the anthropomorphites, that he was convinced by a brother monk of the
        folly of attributing to the Almighty a human form. He bowed his
        reason humbly to the Catholic creed; but when he knelt down to pray,
        the image which his imagination had conceived, and on which for so
        many years his affections had been concentrated, had disappeared, and
        the old man burst into tears, exclaiming, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You have deprived me of my God.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_80" name="noteref_80" href="#note_80"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">80</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are indeed
        facts which must be deeply painful to all who are concerned with the
        history of opinion. The possibility of often adding to the happiness
        of men by diffusing abroad, or at least sustaining pleasing
        falsehoods, and the suffering that must commonly result from their
        dissolution, can hardly reasonably be denied. There is one, and but
        one, adequate reason that can always justify men in critically
        reviewing what they have been taught. It is, the conviction that
        opinions should not be regarded as mere mental luxuries, that truth
        should be deemed an end distinct from and superior to utility, and
        that it is a moral duty to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg
        053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        pursue it, whether it leads to pleasure or whether it leads to pain.
        Among the many wise sayings which antiquity ascribed to Pythagoras,
        few are more remarkable than his division of virtue into two distinct
        branches—to be truthful and to do good.<a id="noteref_81" name=
        "noteref_81" href="#note_81"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">81</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the sanctions
        which, according to the utilitarians, constitute the sole motives to
        virtue, there is one, as I have said, unexceptionably adequate. Those
        who adopt the religious sanction, can always appeal to a balance of
        interest in favour of virtue; but as the great majority of modern
        utilitarians confidently sever their theory from all theological
        considerations, I will dismiss this sanction with two or three
        remarks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, it is obvious that those who regard the arbitrary will of the
        Deity as the sole rule of morals, render it perfectly idle to
        represent the Divine attributes as deserving of our admiration. To
        speak of the goodness of God, either implies that there is such a
        quality as goodness, to which the Divine acts conform, or it is an
        unmeaning tautology. Why should we extol, or how can we admire, the
        perfect goodness of a Being whose will and acts constitute the sole
        standard or definition of perfection?<a id="noteref_82" name=
        "noteref_82" href="#note_82"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a> The
        theory which teaches that the arbitrary will of the Deity is the one
        rule of morals, and the anticipation of future rewards and
        punishments the one reason for conforming to it, consists of two
        parts. The first annihilates the goodness of God; the second, the
        virtue of man.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
        054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another and
        equally obvious remark is, that while these theologians represent the
        hope of future rewards, and the fear of future punishments, as the
        only reason for doing right, one of our strongest reasons for
        believing in the existence of these rewards and punishments, is our
        deep-seated feeling of merit and demerit. That the present
        disposition of affairs is in many respects unjust, that suffering
        often attends a course which deserves reward, and happiness a course
        which deserves punishment, leads men to infer a future state of
        retribution. Take away the consciousness of desert, and the inference
        would no longer be made.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A third remark,
        which I believe to be equally true, but which may not be acquiesced
        in with equal readiness, is that without the concurrence of a moral
        faculty, it is wholly impossible to prove from nature that supreme
        goodness of the Creator, which utilitarian theologians assume. We
        speak of the benevolence shown in the joy of the insect glittering in
        the sunbeam, in the protecting instincts so liberally bestowed among
        the animal world, in the kindness of the parent to its young, in the
        happiness of little children, in the beauty and the bounty of nature,
        but is there not another side to the picture? The hideous disease,
        the countless forms of rapine and of suffering, the entozoa that live
        within the bodies, and feed upon the anguish of sentient beings, the
        ferocious instinct of the cat, that prolongs with delight the agonies
        of its victim, all the multitudinous forms of misery that are
        manifested among the innocent portion of creation, are not these also
        the works of nature? We speak of the Divine veracity. What is the
        whole history of the intellectual progress of the world but one long
        struggle of the intellect of man to emancipate itself from the
        deceptions of nature? Every object that meets the eye of the savage
        awakens his curiosity only to lure him into some deadly error. The
        sun that seems a diminutive light revolving around his world; the
        moon and the stars that appear formed only to light his path; the
        strange <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name=
        "Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> fantastic diseases
        that suggest irresistibly the notion of present dæmons; the terrific
        phenomena of nature which appear the results, not of blind forces,
        but of isolated spiritual agencies—all these things fatally,
        inevitably, invincibly impel him into superstition. Through long
        centuries the superstitions thus generated have deluged the world
        with blood. Millions of prayers have been vainly breathed to what we
        now know were inexorable laws of nature. Only after ages of toil did
        the mind of man emancipate itself from those deadly errors to which
        by the deceptive appearances of nature the long infancy of humanity
        is universally doomed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And in the laws of
        wealth how different are the appearances from the realities of
        things! Who can estimate the wars that have been kindled, the
        bitterness and the wretchedness that have been caused, by errors
        relating to the apparent antagonism of the interests of nations which
        were so natural that for centuries they entangled the very strongest
        intellects, and it was scarcely till our own day that a tardy science
        came to dispel them?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What shall we say
        to these things? If induction alone were our guide, if we possessed
        absolutely no knowledge of some things being in their own nature
        good, and others in their own nature evil, how could we rise from
        this spectacle of nature to the conception of an all-perfect Author?
        Even if we could discover a predominance of benevolence in the
        creation, we should still regard the mingled attributes of nature as
        a reflex of the mingled attributes of its Contriver. Our knowledge of
        the Supreme Excellence, our best evidence even of the existence of
        the Creator, is derived not from the material universe but from our
        own moral nature.<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href=

        id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not of reason but of faith. In
        other words it springs from that instinctive or moral nature which is
        as truly a part of our being as is our reason, which teaches us what
        reason could never teach, the supreme and transcendent excellence of
        moral good, which rising dissatisfied above this world of sense,
        proves itself by the very intensity of its aspiration to be adapted
        for another sphere, and which constitutes at once the evidence of a
        Divine element within us, and the augury of the future that is before
        us.<a id="noteref_84" name="noteref_84" href="#note_84"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These things
        belong rather to the sphere of feeling than of reasoning. Those who
        are most deeply persuaded of their truth, will probably feel that
        they are unable by argument to express adequately the intensity of
        their conviction, but they may point to the recorded experience of
        the best and greatest men in all ages, to the incapacity of
        terrestrial things to satisfy our nature, to the manifest tendency,
        both in individuals and nations, of a pure and heroic life to kindle,
        and of a selfish and corrupt life to cloud, these aspirations, to the
        historical fact that no philosophy and no scepticism have been able
        permanently to repress them. The lines of our moral nature tend
        upwards. In it we have the common root of religion and of ethics, for
        the same consciousness that tells us that, even when it is in fact
        the weakest element of our constitution, it is by right supreme,
        commanding and authoritative, teaches us also that it is Divine. All
        the nobler religions that have governed mankind, have done so by
        virtue of the affinity of their teaching with this nature, by
        speaking, as common religious language correctly describes it,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to the heart,”</span> by appealing not to
        self-interest, but to that Divine element of self-sacrifice which is
        latent in every soul.<a id="noteref_85" name="noteref_85" href=

        involves that connection between our own and a higher nature, without

        archæology, and religion but an exercise of the imagination.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I return gladly to
        the secular sanctions of utilitarianism. The majority of its
        disciples assure us that these are sufficient to establish their
        theory, or in other words, that our duty coincides so strictly with
        our interest when rightly understood, that a perfectly prudent would
        necessarily become a perfectly virtuous man.<a id="noteref_86" name=

        vice they tell us ultimately brings bodily weakness and suffering.
        Extravagance is followed by ruin; unbridled passions by the loss of
        domestic peace; disregard for the interests of others by social or
        legal penalties; while on the other hand, the most moral is also the
        most tranquil disposition; benevolence is one of the truest of our
        pleasures, and virtue may become by habit, an essential of enjoyment.
        As the shopkeeper who has made his fortune, still sometimes continues
        at the counter, because the daily routine has become necessary to his
        happiness, so the <span class="tei tei-q">“moral hero”</span> may
        continue to practise that virtue which was at first the mere
        instrument of his pleasures, as being in itself more precious than
        all besides.<a id="noteref_87" name="noteref_87" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This theory of the
        perfect coincidence of virtue and interest rightly understood, which
        has always been a commonplace of moralists, and has been advocated by
        many who were far from wishing to resolve virtue into prudence,
        contains no doubt a certain amount of truth, but only of the most
        general kind. It does not apply to nations as wholes, for although
        luxurious and effeminate vices do undoubtedly corrode and enervate
        national character, the histories of ancient Rome and of not a few
        modern monarchies abundantly prove that a career of consistent
        rapacity, ambition, selfishness, and fraud may be eminently conducive
        to national prosperity.<a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href=
        "#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a> It does
        not apply to imperfectly organised societies, where the restraints of
        public opinion are unfelt and where force is the one measure of
        right. It does not apply except in a very partial degree even to the
        most civilised of mankind. It is, indeed, easy to show that in a
        polished community a certain low standard of virtue is essential to
        prosperity, to paint the evils of unrestrained passions, and to prove
        that it is better to obey than to violate the laws of society. But if
        turning from the criminal or the drunkard we were to compare the man
        who simply falls in with or slightly surpasses the average morals of
        those about <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg
        059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        him, and indulges in a little vice which is neither injurious to his
        own health nor to his reputation, with the man who earnestly and
        painfully adopts a much higher standard than that of his time or of
        his class, we should be driven to another conclusion. Honesty it is
        said is the best policy—a fact, however, which depends very much upon
        the condition of the police force—but heroic virtue must rest upon a
        different basis. If happiness in any of its forms be the supreme
        object of life, moderation is the most emphatic counsel of our being,
        but moderation is as opposed to heroism as to vice. There is no form
        of intellectual or moral excellence which has not a general tendency
        to produce happiness if cultivated in moderation. There are very few
        which if cultivated to great perfection have not a tendency directly
        the reverse. Thus a mind that is sufficiently enlarged to range
        abroad amid the pleasures of intellect has no doubt secured a fund of
        inexhaustible enjoyment; but he who inferred from this that the
        highest intellectual eminence was the condition most favourable to
        happiness would be lamentably deceived. The diseased nervous
        sensibility that accompanies intense mental exertion, the weary,
        wasting sense of ignorance and vanity, the disenchantment and
        disintegration that commonly follow a profound research, have filled
        literature with mournful echoes of the words of the royal sage,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“In much wisdom is much grief, and he that
        increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.”</span> The lives of men of
        genius have been for the most part a conscious and deliberate
        realisation of the ancient myth—the tree of knowledge and the tree of
        life stood side by side, and they chose the tree of knowledge rather
        than the tree of life.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor is it
        otherwise in the realm of morals.<a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89"

        virtue which is most conducive to happiness is plainly that which
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060"
        id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> can be realised without much
        suffering, and sustained without much effort. Legal and physical
        penalties apply only to the grosser and more extreme forms of vice.
        Social penalties may strike the very highest forms of virtue.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a> That
        very sentiment of unity with mankind which utilitarians assure us is
        one day to become so strong as to overpower all unsocial feelings,
        would make it more and more impossible for men consistently with
        their happiness to adopt any course, whether very virtuous or very
        vicious, that would place them out of harmony with the general
        sentiment of society. It may be said that the tranquillity of a
        perfectly virtuous mind is the highest form of happiness, and may be
        reasonably preferred not only to material advantages, but also to the
        approbation of society; but no man can fully attain, and few can even
        approximate, to such a condition. When vicious passions and impulses
        are very strong, it is idle to tell the sufferer that he would be
        more happy if his nature were radically different from what it is. If
        happiness be his object, he must regulate his course with a view to
        the actual condition of his being, and there can be little doubt that
        his peace would be most promoted by a compromise with vice. The
        selfish theory of morals applies only to the virtues of temperament,
        and not to that much higher form of virtue which is sustained in
        defiance of temperament.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href=
        "#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a> We have
        no doubt a certain pleasure in cultivating our good tendencies, but
        we have by no means the same pleasure in repressing our bad ones.
        There are men whose whole lives are spent in willing one thing, and
        desiring the opposite. In such cases as these <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> virtue clearly involves a sacrifice of
        happiness; for the suffering caused by resisting natural tendencies
        is much greater than would ensue from their moderate
        gratification.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The plain truth is
        that no proposition can be more palpably and egregiously false than
        the assertion that as far as this world is concerned, it is
        invariably conducive to the happiness of a man to pursue the most
        virtuous career. Circumstances and disposition will make one man find
        his highest happiness in the happiness, and another man in the
        misery, of his kind; and if the second man acts according to his
        interest, the utilitarian, however much he may deplore the result,
        has no right to blame or condemn the agent. For that agent is
        following his greatest happiness, and this, in the eyes of
        utilitarians, in one form or another, is the highest, or to speak
        more accurately, the only motive by which human nature can be
        actuated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may remark too
        that the disturbance or pain which does undoubtedly usually accompany
        what is evil, bears no kind of proportion to the enormity of the
        guilt. An irritability of temper, which is chiefly due to a
        derangement of the nervous system, or a habit of procrastination or
        indecision, will often cause more suffering than some of the worst
        vices that can corrupt the heart.<a id="noteref_92" name="noteref_92"
        href="#note_92"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">92</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it may be said
        this calculation of pains and pleasures is defective through the
        omission of one element. Although a man who had a very strong natural
        impulse towards some vice would appear more likely to promote the
        tranquillity of his nature by a moderate and circumspect
        gratification of that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg
        062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        vice, than by endeavouring painfully to repress his natural
        tendencies, yet he possesses a conscience which adjudicates upon his
        conduct, and its sting or its approval constitutes a pain or pleasure
        so intense, as more than to redress the balance. Now of course, no
        intuitive moralist will deny, what for a long time his school may be
        almost said to have been alone in asserting, the reality of
        conscience, or the pleasures and pains it may afford. He simply
        denies, and he appeals to consciousness in attestation of his
        position, that those pains and pleasures are so powerful or so
        proportioned to our acts as to become an adequate basis for virtue.
        Conscience, whether we regard it as an original faculty, or as a
        product of the association of ideas, exercises two distinct
        functions. It points out a difference between right and wrong, and
        when its commands are violated, it inflicts a certain measure of
        suffering and disturbance. The first function it exercises
        persistently through life. The second it only exercises under certain
        special circumstances. It is scarcely conceivable that a man in the
        possession of his faculties should pass a life of gross depravity and
        crime without being conscious that he was doing wrong; but it is
        extremely possible for him to do so without this consciousness having
        any appreciable influence upon his tranquillity. The condition of
        their consciences, as Mr. Carlyle observes, has less influence on the
        happiness of men than the condition of their livers. Considered as a
        source of pain, conscience bears a striking resemblance to the
        feeling of disgust. Notwithstanding the assertion of Dr. Johnson, I
        venture to maintain that there are multitudes to whom the necessity
        of discharging the duties of a butcher would be so inexpressibly
        painful and revolting, that if they could obtain flesh diet on no
        other condition, they would relinquish it for ever. But to those who
        are inured to the trade, this repugnance has simply ceased. It has no
        place in their emotions or calculations. Nor can it be reasonably
        questioned that most men by an assiduous <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> attendance at the slaughter-house could acquire
        a similar indifference. In like manner, the reproaches of conscience
        are doubtless a very real and important form of suffering to a
        sensitive, scrupulous, and virtuous girl who has committed some
        trivial act of levity or disobedience; but to an old and hardened
        criminal they are a matter of the most absolute indifference.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is
        undoubtedly conceivable, that by an association of ideas men might
        acquire a feeling that would cause that which would naturally be
        painful to them to be pleasurable, and that which would naturally be
        pleasurable to be painful.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href=
        "#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> But the
        question will immediately arise, why should they respect this
        feeling? We have seen that, according to the inductive theory, there
        is no such thing as natural duty. Men enter into life solely desirous
        of seeking their own happiness. The whole edifice of virtue arises
        from the observed fact, that owing to the constitution of our nature,
        and the intimacy of our social relations, it is necessary for our
        happiness to abstain from some courses that would be immediately
        pleasurable and to pursue others that are immediately the reverse.
        Self-interest is the one ultimate reason for virtue, however much
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064"
        id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the moral chemistry of Hartley
        may disguise and transform it. Ought or ought not, means nothing more
        than the prospect of acquiring or of losing pleasure. The fact that
        one line of conduct promotes, and another impairs the happiness of
        others is, according to these moralists, in the last analysis, no
        reason whatever for pursuing the former or avoiding the latter,
        unless such a course is that which brings us the greatest happiness.
        The happiness may arise from the action of society upon ourselves, or
        from our own naturally benevolent disposition, or, again, from an
        association of ideas, which means the force of a habit we have
        formed, but in any case our own happiness is the one possible or
        conceivable motive of action. If this be a true picture of human
        nature, the reasonable course for every man is to modify his
        disposition in such a manner that he may attain the greatest possible
        amount of enjoyment. If he has formed an association of ideas, or
        contracted a habit which inflicts more pain than it prevents, or
        prevents more pleasure than it affords, his reasonable course is to
        dissolve that association, to destroy that habit. This is what he
        <span class="tei tei-q">“ought”</span> to do according to the only
        meaning that word can possess in the utilitarian vocabulary. If he
        does not, he will justly incur the charge of imprudence, which is the
        only charge utilitarianism can consistently bring against vice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That it would be
        for the happiness as it would certainly be in the power of a man of a
        temperament such as I have lately described, to quench that
        conscientious feeling, which by its painful reproaches prevents him
        from pursuing the course that would be most conducive to his
        tranquillity, I conceive to be self-evident. And, indeed, on the
        whole, it is more than doubtful whether conscience, considered apart
        from the course of action it prescribes, is not the cause of more
        pain than pleasure. Its reproaches are more felt than its approval.
        The self-complacency of a virtuous man reflecting with delight upon
        his own exceeding merit, is frequently <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> spoken of in the writings of moral
        philosophers,<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href=
        "#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a> but is
        rarely found in actual life where the most tranquil is seldom the
        most perfect nature, where the sensitiveness of conscience increases
        at least in proportion to moral growth, and where in the best men a
        feeling of modesty and humility is always present to check the
        exuberance of self-gratulation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In every sound
        system of morals and religion the motives of virtue become more
        powerful the more the mind is concentrated upon them. It is when they
        are lost sight of, when they are obscured by passion, unrealised or
        forgotten, that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
        066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        they cease to operate. But it is a peculiarity of the utilitarian
        conception of virtue that it is wholly unable to resist the solvent
        of analysis, and that the more the mind realises its origin and its
        nature, the more its influence on character must decline. The
        pleasures of the senses will always defy the force of analysis, for
        they have a real foundation in our being. They have their basis in
        the eternal nature of things. But the pleasure we derive from the
        practice of virtue rests, according to this school, on a wholly
        different basis. It is the result of casual and artificial
        association, of habit, of a confusion by the imagination of means
        with ends, of a certain dignity with which society invests qualities
        or actions that are useful to itself. Just in proportion as this is
        felt, just in proportion as the mind separates the idea of virtue
        from that of natural excellence and obligation, and realises the
        purely artificial character of the connection, just in that
        proportion will the coercive power of the moral motive be destroyed.
        The utilitarian rule of judging actions and dispositions by their
        tendency to promote or diminish happiness, or the maxim of Kant that
        man should always act so that the rule of his conduct might be
        adopted as a law by all rational beings, may be very useful as a
        guide in life; but in order that they should acquire moral weight, it
        is necessary to presuppose the sense of moral obligation, the
        consciousness that duty, when discovered, has a legitimate claim to
        be the guiding principle of our lives. And it is this element which,
        in the eye of reason, the mere artificial association of ideas can
        never furnish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the patience of
        the reader has enabled him to accompany me through this long train of
        tedious arguments, he will, I think, have concluded that the
        utilitarian theory, though undoubtedly held by many men of the
        purest, and by some men of almost heroic virtue, would if carried to
        its logical conclusions prove subversive of morality, and especially,
        and in the very highest degree, unfavourable to <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> self-denial and to heroism. Even if it
        explains these, it fails to justify them, and conscience being traced
        to a mere confusion of the means of happiness with its end, would be
        wholly unable to resist the solvent of criticism. That this theory of
        conscience gives a true or adequate description of the phenomenon it
        seeks to explain, no intuitive moralist will admit. It is a complete
        though common mistake to suppose that the business of the moralist is
        merely to explain the genesis of certain feelings we possess. At the
        root of all morals lies an intellectual judgment which is clearly
        distinct from liking or disliking, from pleasure or from pain. A man
        who has injured his position by some foolish but perfectly innocent
        act, or who has inadvertently violated some social rule, may
        experience an emotion of self-reproach or of shame quite as acute as
        if he had committed a crime. But he is at the same time clearly
        conscious that his conduct is not a fit subject for moral
        reprobation, that the grounds on which it may be condemned are of a
        different and of a lower kind. The sense of obligation and of
        legitimate supremacy, which is the essential and characteristic
        feature of conscience, and which distinguishes it from all the other
        parts of our nature, is wholly unaccounted for by the association of
        ideas. To say that a certain course of conduct is pleasing, and that
        a certain amount of pain results from the weakening of feelings that
        impel men towards it, is plainly different from what men mean when
        they say we ought to pursue it. The virtue of Hartley is, in its last
        analysis, but a disease of the imagination. It may be more
        advantageous to society than avarice; but it is formed in the same
        manner, and has exactly the same degree of binding force.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These
        considerations will help to supply an answer to the common
        utilitarian objection that to speak of duty as distinct from
        self-interest is unmeaning, because it is absurd to say that we are
        under an obligation to do any thing when no evil consequences would
        result to us from not doing it. Rewards and punishments it may be
        answered are undoubtedly necessary to enforce, but they are not
        necessary to constitute, duty. This distinction, whether it be real
        or not, has at all events the advantage of appearing self-evident to
        all who are not philosophers. Thus when a party of colonists occupy a
        new territory they divide the unoccupied land among themselves, and
        they murder, or employ for the gratification of their lusts, the
        savage inhabitants. Both acts are done with perfect impunity, but one
        is felt to be innocent and the other wrong. A lawful government
        appropriates the land and protects the aboriginals, supporting its
        enactments by penalties. In the one case the law both creates and
        enforces a duty, in the other it only enforces it. The intuitive
        moralist simply asserts that we have the power of perceiving that
        certain courses of action are higher, nobler, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and better than others, and that by the
        constitution of our being, this fact, which is generically distinct
        from the prospect of pleasure or the reverse, may and ought to be and
        continually is a motive of action. It is no doubt possible for a man
        to prefer the lower course, and in this case we say he is deserving
        of punishment, and if he remains unpunished we say that it is unjust.
        But if there were no power to reward or punish him, his acts would
        not be indifferent. They would still be intelligibly described as
        essentially base or noble, shameful though there were none to
        censure, admirable though there were none to admire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That men have the
        power of preferring other objects than happiness is a proposition
        which must ultimately be left to the attestation of consciousness.
        That the pursuit of virtue, however much happiness may eventually
        follow in its train, is in the first instance an example of this
        preference, must be established by that common voice of mankind which
        has invariably regarded a virtuous motive as generically different
        from an interested one. And indeed even when the conflict between
        strong passions and a strong sense of duty does not exist it is
        impossible to measure the degrees of virtue by the scale of
        enjoyment. The highest nature is rarely the happiest. Petronius
        Arbiter was, very probably, a happier man than Marcus Aurelius. For
        eighteen centuries the religious instinct of Christendom has
        recognised its ideal in the form of a <span class="tei tei-q">“Man of
        Sorrows.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considerations
        such as I have now urged lead the intuitive moralists to reject the
        principles of the utilitarian. They acknowledge indeed that the
        effect of actions upon the happiness of mankind forms a most
        important element in determining their moral quality, but they
        maintain that without natural moral perceptions we never should have
        known that it was our duty to seek the happiness of mankind when it
        diverged from our own, and they deny that virtue was either
        originally evolved from or is necessarily <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page070">[pg 070]</span><a name="Pg070" id="Pg070" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> proportioned to utility. They acknowledge that
        in the existing condition of society there is at least a general
        coincidence between the paths of virtue and of prosperity, but they
        contend that the obligation of virtue is of such a nature that no
        conceivable convulsion of affairs could destroy it, and that it would
        continue even if the government of the world belonged to supreme
        malice instead of supreme benevolence. Virtue, they believe, is
        something more than a calculation or a habit. It is impossible to
        conceive its fundamental principles reversed. Notwithstanding the
        strong tendency to confuse cognate feelings, the sense of duty and
        the sense of utility remain perfectly distinct in the apprehension of
        mankind, and we are quite capable of recognising each separate
        ingredient in the same act. Our respect for a gallant but dangerous
        enemy, our contempt for a useful traitor, our care in the last
        moments of life for the interests of those who survive us, our clear
        distinction between intentional and unintentional injuries, and
        between the consciousness of imprudence and the consciousness of
        guilt, our conviction that the pursuit of interest should always be
        checked by a sense of duty, and that selfish and moral motives are so
        essentially opposed, that the presence of the former necessarily
        weakens the latter, our indignation at those who when honour or
        gratitude call them to sacrifice their interests pause to calculate
        remote consequences, the feeling of remorse which differs from every
        other emotion of our nature—in a word, the universal, unstudied
        sentiments of mankind all concur in leading us to separate widely our
        virtuous affections from our selfish ones. Just as pleasure and pain
        are ultimate grounds of action, and no reason can be given why we
        should seek the former and avoid the latter, except that it is the
        constitution of our nature that we should do so, so we are conscious
        that the words right and wrong express ultimate intelligible motives,
        that these motives are generically different from the others, that
        they are <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg
        071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        a higher order, and that they carry with them a sense of obligation.
        Any scheme of morals that omits these facts fails to give an accurate
        and adequate description of the states of feeling which consciousness
        reveals. The consciences of men in every age would have echoed the
        assertion of Cicero that to sacrifice pleasure with a view of
        obtaining any form or modification of pleasure in return, no more
        answers to our idea of virtue, than to lend money at interest to our
        idea of charity. The conception of pure disinterestedness is
        presupposed in our estimates of virtue. It is the root of all the
        emotions with which we contemplate acts of heroism. We feel that man
        is capable of pursuing what he believes to be right although pain and
        disaster and mental suffering and an early death be the consequence,
        and although no prospect of future reward lighten upon his tomb. This
        is the highest prerogative of our being, the point of contact between
        the human nature and the divine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to the
        direct arguments in its support, the utilitarian school owes much of
        its influence to some very powerful moral and intellectual
        predispositions in its favour—the first, which we shall hereafter
        examine, consisting of the tendency manifested in certain conditions
        of society towards the qualities it is most calculated to produce,
        and the second of the almost irresistible attraction which unity and
        precision exercise on many minds. It was this desire to simplify
        human nature, by reducing its various faculties and complex
        operations to a single principle or process, that gave its great
        popularity to the sensational school of the last century. It led most
        metaphysicians of that school to deny the duality of human nature. It
        led Bonnet and Condillac to propose an animated statue, endowed with
        the five senses as channels of ideas, and with faculties exclusively
        employed in transforming the products of sensation, as a perfect
        representative of humanity. It led Helvétius to assert that the
        original faculties of all men were precisely the same, all the
        difference <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg
        072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        between what we call genius and what we call stupidity arising from
        differences of circumstances, and all the difference between men and
        animals arising mainly from the structure of the human hand. In
        morals, theories of unification are peculiarly plausible, and I think
        peculiarly dangerous, because, owing to the interaction of our moral
        sentiments, and the many transformations that each can undergo, there
        are few affections that might not under some conceivable
        circumstances become the parents of every other. When Hobbes, in the
        name of the philosophy of self-interest, contended that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pity is but the imagination of future calamity to
        ourselves, produced by the sense of another man's

        Hutcheson, in the name of the philosophy of benevolence, argued that
        the vice of intemperance is that it impels us to violence towards
        others, and weakens our capacity for doing them good;<a id=

        other moralists defending the excellence of our nature maintained
        that compassion is so emphatically the highest of our pleasures that
        a desire of gratifying it is the cause of our acts of
        barbarity;<a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href=

        these theories, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg
        073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        extravagant as it is, contains a germ of undoubted psychological
        truth. It is true that a mind intensely apprehensive of future
        calamities would on that account receive a shock at the sight of the
        calamities of others. It is true that a very keen and absorbing
        sentiment of benevolence would be in itself sufficient to divert men
        from any habit that impaired their power of gratifying it. It is true
        that compassion involves a certain amount of pleasure, and
        conceivable that that pleasure might be so intensified that we might
        seek it by a crime. The error in these theories is not that they
        exaggerate the possible efficacy of the motives, but that they
        exaggerate their actual intensity in human nature and describe
        falsely the process by which the results they seek to explain have
        been arrived at. The function of observation in moral philosophy is
        not simply to attest the moral sentiments we possess, leaving it to
        the reason to determine deductively how they may have been formed; it
        is rather to follow them through all the stages of their
        formation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And here I may
        observe that the term inductive, like most others that are employed
        in moral philosophy, may give <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> rise to serious misconception. It is properly
        applied to those moralists who, disbelieving the existence of any
        moral sense or faculty revealing to us what is right and wrong,
        maintain that the origin of those ideas is simply our experience of
        the tendency of different lines of conduct to promote or impair true
        happiness. It appears, however, to be sometimes imagined that
        inductive moralists alone think that it is by induction or experience
        that we ought to ascertain what is the origin of our moral ideas. But
        this I conceive to be a complete mistake. The basis of morals is a
        distinct question from the basis of theories of morals. Those who
        maintain the existence of a moral faculty do not, as is sometimes
        said, assume this proposition as a first principle of their
        arguments, but they arrive at it by a process of induction quite as
        severe as any that can be employed by their opponents.<a id=
        "noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class=

        examine, analyse, and classify their existing moral feelings,
        ascertain in what respects those feelings agree with or differ from
        others, trace them through their various phases, and only assign them
        to a special faculty when they think they have shown them to be
        incapable of resolution, and generically different from all
        others.<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href=
        "#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This separation is
        all that is meant by a moral faculty. We are apt to regard the term
        as implying a distinct and well defined organ, bearing to the mind
        the same kind of relation as a limb to the body. But of the existence
        of such organs, and of the propriety of such material imagery, we
        know nothing. Perceiving in ourselves a will, and a crowd of
        intellectual and emotional phenomena that seem wholly different from
        the properties of matter, we infer the existence of an immaterial
        substance which wills, thinks, and feels, and can classify its own
        operations with considerable precision. The term faculty is simply an
        expression of classification. If we say that the moral faculty
        differs from the æsthetic faculty, we can only mean that the mind
        forms certain judgments of moral excellence, and also certain
        judgments of beauty, and that these two mental processes are clearly
        distinct. To ask to what part of our nature moral perceptions should
        be attributed, is only to ask to what train of mental phenomena they
        bear the closest resemblance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this simple,
        but often neglected, consideration be borne <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in mind, the apparent discordance of intuitive
        moralists will appear less profound than might at first sight be
        supposed, for each section merely elucidates some one characteristic
        of moral judgments. Thus Butler insists upon the sense of obligation
        that is involved in them, contends that this separates them from all
        other sentiments, and assigns them in consequence to a special
        faculty of supreme authority called conscience. Adam Smith and many
        other writers were especially struck by their sympathetic character.
        We are naturally attracted by humanity, and repelled by cruelty, and
        this instinctive, unreasoning sentiment constitutes, according to
        these moralists, the difference between right and wrong. Cudworth,
        however, the English precursor of Kant, had already anticipated, and
        later metaphysicians have more fully exhibited, the inadequacy of
        such an analysis. Justice, humanity, veracity, and kindred virtues
        not merely have the power of attracting us, we have also an
        intellectual perception that they are essentially and immutably good,
        that their nature does not depend upon, and is not relative to, our
        constitutions; that it is impossible and inconceivable they should
        ever be vices, and their opposites, virtues. They are, therefore, it
        is said, intuitions of the reason. Clarke, developing the same
        rational school, and following in the steps of those moralists who
        regard our nature as a hierarchy of powers or faculties, with
        different degrees of dignity, and an appropriate order of supremacy
        and subordination, maintained that virtue consisted in harmony with
        the nature of things. Wollaston endeavoured to reduce it to truth,
        and Hutcheson to benevolence, which he maintained is recognised and
        approved by what his respect for the philosophy of Locke induced him
        to call <span class="tei tei-q">“a moral sense,”</span> but what
        Shaftesbury had regarded as a moral <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“taste.”</span> The pleasure attending the gratification
        of this taste, according to Shaftesbury and Henry More, is the motive
        to virtue. The doctrine of a moral sense or faculty was the basis of
        the ethics of Reid. Hume maintained that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the peculiar quality of virtue is its utility,
        but that our affections are purely disinterested, and that we arrive
        at our knowledge of what is virtuous by a moral sense implanted in
        our nature, which leads us instinctively to approve of all acts that
        are beneficial to others. Expanding a pregnant hint which had been
        thrown out by Butler, he laid the foundation for a union of the
        schools of Clarke and Shaftesbury, by urging that our moral decisions
        are not simple, but complex, containing both a judgment of the
        reason, and an emotion of the heart. This fact has been elucidated
        still further by later writers, who have observed that these two
        elements apply in varying degrees to different kinds of virtue.
        According to Lord Kames, our intellectual perception of right and
        wrong applies most strictly to virtues like justice or veracity,
        which are of what is called <span class="tei tei-q">“perfect
        obligation,”</span> or, in other words, are of such a nature, that
        their violation is a distinct crime, while the emotion of attraction
        or affection is shown most strongly towards virtues of imperfect
        obligation, like benevolence or charity. Like Hutcheson and
        Shaftesbury, Lord Kames notices the analogies between our moral and
        æsthetical judgments.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These last
        analogies open out a region of thought widely different from that we
        have been traversing. The close connection between the good and the
        beautiful has been always felt, so much so, that both were in Greek
        expressed by the same word, and in the philosophy of Plato, moral
        beauty was regarded as the archetype of which all visible beauty is
        only the shadow or the image. We all feel that there is a strict
        propriety in the term moral beauty. We feel that there are different
        forms of beauty which have a natural correspondence to different
        moral qualities, and much of the charm of poetry and eloquence rests
        upon this harmony. We feel that we have a direct, immediate,
        intuitive perception that some objects, such as the sky above us, are
        beautiful, that this perception of beauty is totally different, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078"
        id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> could not possibly be derived,
        from a perception of their utility, and that it bears a very striking
        resemblance to the instantaneous and unreasoning admiration elicited
        by a generous or heroic action. We perceive too, if we examine with
        care the operations of our own mind, that an æsthetical judgment
        includes an intuition or intellectual perception, and an emotion of
        attraction or admiration, very similar to those which compose a moral
        judgment. The very idea of beauty again implies that it should be
        admired, as the idea of happiness implies that it should be desired,
        and the idea of duty that it should be performed. There is also a
        striking correspondence between the degree and kind of uniformity we
        can in each case discover. That there is a difference between right
        and wrong, and between beauty and ugliness, are both propositions
        which are universally felt. That right is better than wrong, and
        beauty than ugliness, are equally unquestioned. When we go further,
        and attempt to define the nature of these qualities, we are met
        indeed by great diversities of detail, but by a far larger amount of
        substantial unity. Poems like the Iliad or the Psalms, springing in
        the most dissimilar quarters, have commanded the admiration of men,
        through all the changes of some 3,000 years. The charm of music, the
        harmony of the female countenance, the majesty of the starry sky, of
        the ocean or of the mountain, the gentler beauties of the murmuring
        stream or of the twilight shades, were felt, as they are felt now,
        when the imagination of the infant world first embodied itself in
        written words. And in the same way types of heroism, and of virtue,
        descending from the remotest ages, command the admiration of mankind.
        We can sympathise with the emotions of praise or blame revealed in
        the earliest historians, and the most ancient moralists strike a
        responsive chord in every heart. The broad lines remain unchanged. No
        one ever contended that justice was a vice or injustice a virtue; or
        that a summer sunset was a repulsive object, or that the sores upon a
        human <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name=
        "Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> body were beautiful.
        Always, too, the objects of æsthetical admiration were divided into
        two great classes, the sublime and the beautiful, which in ethics
        have their manifest counterparts in the heroic and the amiable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, again, we
        examine the undoubted diversities that exist in judgments of virtue
        and of beauty, we soon discover that in each case a large proportion
        of them are to be ascribed to the different degrees of civilisation.
        The moral standard changes within certain limits, and according to a
        regular process with the evolutions of society. There are virtues
        very highly estimated in a rude civilisation which sink into
        comparative insignificance in an organised society, while conversely,
        virtues that were deemed secondary in the first become primary in the
        other. There are even virtues that it is impossible for any but
        highly cultivated minds to recognise. Questions of virtue and vice,
        such as the difference between humanity and barbarity, or between
        temperance and intemperance, are sometimes merely questions of
        degree, and the standard at one stage of civilisation may be much
        higher than at another. Just in the same way a steady modification of
        tastes, while a recognition of the broad features of beauty remains
        unchanged, accompanies advancing civilisation. The preference of
        gaudy to subdued tints, of colour to form, of a florid to a chaste
        style, of convulsive attitudes, gigantic figures, and strong
        emotions, may be looked for with considerable confidence in an
        uninstructed people. The refining influence of cultivation is in no
        sphere more remarkable than in the canons of taste it produces, and
        there are few better measures of the civilisation of a people than
        the conceptions of beauty it forms, the type or ideal it endeavours
        to realise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many diversities,
        however, both of moral and æsthetical judgments, may be traced to
        accidental causes. Some one who is greatly admired, or who possesses
        great influence, is distinguished by some peculiarity of appearance,
        or introduces some peculiarity of dress. He will soon find countless
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080"
        id="Pg080" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> imitators. Gradually the
        natural sense of beauty will become vitiated; the eye and the taste
        will adjust themselves to a false and artificial standard, and men
        will at last judge according to it with the most absolute
        spontaneity. In the same way, if any accidental circumstance has
        elevated an indifferent action to peculiar honour, if a religious
        system enforces it as a virtue or brands it as a vice, the
        consciences of men will after a time accommodate themselves to the
        sentence, and an appeal to a wider than a local tribunal is necessary
        to correct the error. Every nation, again, from its peculiar
        circumstances and position, tends to some particular type, both of
        beauty and of virtue, and it naturally extols its national type
        beyond all others. The virtues of a small poor nation, living among
        barren mountains, surrounded by powerful enemies, and maintaining its
        independence only by the most inflexible discipline, watchfulness,
        and courage, will be in some degree different from those of a rich
        people removed from all fear of invasion and placed in the centre of
        commerce. The former will look with a very lenient eye on acts of
        barbarity or treachery, which to the latter would appear unspeakably
        horrible, and will value very highly certain virtues of discipline
        which the other will comparatively neglect. So, too, the conceptions
        of beauty formed by a nation of negroes will be different from those
        formed by a nation of whites;<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101"
        href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        splendour of a tropical sky or the savage grandeur of a northern
        ocean, the aspect of great mountains or of wide plains, will not only
        supply nations with present images of sublimity or beauty, but will
        also contribute to form their standard and affect their judgments.
        Local customs or observances become so interwoven with our earliest
        recollections, that we at last regard them as essentially
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name="Pg081"
        id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> venerable, and even in the
        most trivial matters it requires a certain effort to dissolve the
        association. There was much wisdom as well as much wit in the picture
        of the novelist who described the English footman's contempt for the
        uniforms of the French, <span class="tei tei-q">“blue being
        altogether ridiculous for regimentals, except in the blue guards and
        artillery;”</span> and I suppose there are few Englishmen into whose
        first confused impression of France there does not enter a
        half-instinctive feeling of repugnance caused by the ferocious
        appearance of a peasantry who are all dressed like butchers.<a id=
        "noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        said<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href=
        "#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the feelings of beauty, grandeur, and
        whatever else is comprehended under the name of taste, do not lead to
        action, but terminate in delightful contemplation, which constitutes
        the essential distinction between them and the moral sentiments to
        which in some points of view they may doubtless be likened.”</span>
        This position I conceive to be altogether untenable. Our æsthetical
        judgment is of the nature of a preference. It leads us to prefer one
        class of objects to another, and whenever other things are equal,
        becomes a ground for action. In choosing the persons with whom we
        live, the neighbourhood we inhabit, the objects that surround us, we
        prefer that which is beautiful to that which is the reverse, and in
        every case in which a choice between beauty and deformity is in
        question, and no counteracting motive intervenes, we choose the
        former, and avoid the latter. There are no doubt innumerable events
        in life in which this question does not arise, but there are also
        very many in which we are not called upon to make a moral judgment.
        We say a man is actuated by strong moral principle who chooses
        according to its dictates in every case involving a moral judgment
        that comes naturally before him, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and who in obedience to its impulse pursues
        special courses of action. Corresponding propositions may be
        maintained with perfect truth concerning our sense of beauty. In
        proportion to its strength does it guide our course in ordinary life,
        and determine our peculiar pursuits. We may indeed sacrifice our
        sense of material beauty to considerations of utility with much more
        alacrity than our sense of moral beauty; we may consent to build a
        shapeless house sooner than to commit a dishonourable action, but we
        cannot voluntarily choose that which is simply deformed, rather than
        that which is beautiful, without a certain feeling of pain, and a
        pain of this kind, according to the school of Hartley, is the precise
        definition of conscience. Nor is it at all difficult to conceive men
        with a sense of beauty so strong that they would die rather than
        outrage it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Considering all
        these things, it is not surprising that many moralists should have
        regarded moral excellence as simply the highest form of beauty, and
        moral cultivation as the supreme refinement of taste. But although
        this manner of regarding it is, as I think, far more plausible than
        the theory which resolves virtue into utility, although the Greek
        moralists and the school of Shaftesbury have abundantly proved that
        there is an extremely close connection between these orders of ideas,
        there are two considerations which appear to show the inadequacy of
        this theory. We are clearly conscious of the propriety of applying
        the epithet <span class="tei tei-q">“beautiful”</span> to virtues
        such as charity, reverence, or devotion, but we cannot apply it with
        the same propriety to duties of perfect obligation, such as veracity
        or integrity. The sense of beauty and the affection that follows it
        attach themselves rather to modes of enthusiasm and feeling than to
        the course of simple duty which constitutes a merely truthful and
        upright man.<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href=
        "#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a> Besides
        this, as the Stoics and Butler have shown, the position <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg 083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of conscience in our nature is wholly
        unique, and clearly separates morals from a study of the beautiful.
        While each of our senses or appetites has a restricted sphere of
        operation, it is the function of conscience to survey the whole
        constitution of our being, and assign limits to the gratification of
        all our various passions and desires. Differing not in degree, but in
        kind from the other principles of our nature, we feel that a course
        of conduct which is opposed to it may be intelligibly described as
        unnatural, even when in accordance with our most natural appetites,
        for to conscience is assigned the prerogative of both judging and
        restraining them all. Its power may be insignificant, but its title
        is undisputed, and <span class="tei tei-q">“if it had might as it has
        right, it would govern the world.”</span><a id="noteref_105" name=
        "noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a> It is
        this faculty, distinct from, and superior to, all appetites,
        passions, and tastes, that makes virtue the supreme law of life, and
        adds an imperative character to the feeling of attraction it
        inspires. It is this which was described by Cicero as the God ruling
        within us; by the Stoics as the sovereignty of reason; by St. Paul as
        the law of nature; by Butler as the supremacy of conscience.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The distinction of
        different parts of our nature, as higher or lower, which appears in
        the foregoing reasoning, and which occupies so important a place in
        the intuitive system of morals, is one that can only be defended by
        the way of illustrations. A writer can only select cases in which
        such distinctions seem most apparent, and leave them to the feelings
        of his reader. A few examples will, I hope, be sufficient to show
        that even in our pleasures, we are not simply determined by the
        amount of enjoyment, but that there is a difference of kind, which
        may be reasonably described by the epithets, higher or lower.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we suppose a
        being from another sphere, who derived his conceptions from a purely
        rational process, without the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> intervention of the senses, to descend to our
        world, and to enquire into the principles of human nature, I imagine
        there are few points that would strike him as more anomalous, or
        which he would be more absolutely unable to realise, than the
        different estimates in which men hold the pleasures derived from the
        two senses of tasting and hearing. Under the first is comprised the
        enjoyment resulting from the action of certain kinds of food upon the
        palate. Under the second the charm of music. Each of these forms of
        pleasure is natural, each can be greatly heightened by cultivation,
        in each case the pleasure may be vivid, but is very transient, and in
        neither case do evil consequences necessarily ensue. Yet with so many
        undoubted points of resemblance, when we turn to the actual world, we
        find the difference between these two orders of pleasure of such a
        nature, that a comparison seems absolutely ludicrous. In what then
        does this difference consist? Not, surely, in the greater intensity
        of the enjoyment derived from music, for in many cases this
        superiority does not exist.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106"
        href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a> We are
        all conscious that in our comparison of these pleasures, there is an
        element distinct from any consideration of their intensity, duration,
        or consequences. We naturally attach a faint notion of shame to the
        one, while we as naturally glory in the other. A very keen sense of
        the pleasures of the palate is looked upon as in a certain degree
        discreditable. A man will hardly boast that he is very fond of
        eating, but he has no hesitation in acknowledging that he is very
        fond of music. The first <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg
        085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        taste lowers, and the second elevates him in his own eyes, and in
        those of his neighbours.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, let a man
        of cheerful disposition, and of a cultivated but not very fastidious
        taste, observe his own emotions and the countenances of those around
        him during the representation of a clever tragedy and of a clever
        farce, and it is probable that he will come to the conclusion that
        his enjoyment in the latter case has been both more unmingled and
        more intense than in the former. He has felt no lassitude, he has not
        endured the amount of pain that necessarily accompanies the pleasure
        of pathos, he has experienced a vivid, absorbing pleasure, and he has
        traced similar emotions in the violent demonstrations of his
        neighbours. Yet he will readily admit that the pleasure derived from
        the tragedy is of a higher order than that derived from the farce.
        Sometimes he will find himself hesitating which of the two he will
        choose. The love of mere enjoyment leads him to the one. A sense of
        its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">nobler</span></em> character inclines him to the
        other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar
        distinction may be observed in other departments. Except in the
        relation of the sexes, it is probable that a more intense pleasure is
        usually obtained from the grotesque and the eccentric, than from the
        perfections of beauty. The pleasure derived from beauty is not
        violent in its nature, and it is in most cases peculiarly mixed with
        melancholy. The feelings of a man who is deeply moved by a lovely
        landscape are rarely those of extreme elation. A shade of melancholy
        steals over his mind. His eyes fill with tears. A vague and
        unsatisfied longing fills his soul. Yet, troubled and broken as is
        this form of enjoyment, few persons would hesitate to pronounce it of
        a higher kind than any that can be derived from the exhibitions of
        oddity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If pleasures were
        the sole objects of our pursuit, and if their excellence were
        measured only by the quantity of enjoyment they afford, nothing could
        appear more obvious than that the man would be esteemed most wise who
        attained <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg
        086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his
        object at least cost. Yet the whole course of civilisation is in a
        precisely opposite direction. A child derives the keenest and most
        exquisite enjoyment from the simplest objects. A flower, a doll, a
        rude game, the least artistic tale, is sufficient to enchant it. An
        uneducated peasant is enraptured with the wildest story and the
        coarsest wit. Increased cultivation almost always produces a
        fastidiousness which renders necessary the increased elaboration of
        our pleasures. We attach a certain discredit to a man who has
        retained those of childhood. The very fact of our deriving pleasure
        from certain amusements creates a kind of humiliation, for we feel
        that they are not in harmony with the nobility of our nature.<a id=
        "noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Our judgments of
        societies resemble in this respect our judgments of individuals. Few
        persons, I think, who have compared the modes of popular life in
        stagnant and undeveloped countries like Spain with those in the great
        centres of industrial civilisation, will venture to pronounce with
        any confidence that the quantum or average of actual realised
        enjoyment is greater in the civilised than in the semi-civilised
        society. An undeveloped nature is by no means necessarily an unhappy
        nature, and although we possess no accurate gauge of happiness, we
        may, at least, be certain that its degrees do not coincide with the
        degrees of prosperity. The tastes and habits of men in a backward
        society accommodate themselves to the narrow circle of a few
        pleasures, and probably <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg
        087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        find in these as complete satisfaction as more civilised men in a
        wider range; and if there is in the first condition somewhat more of
        the weariness of monotony, there is in the second much more of the
        anxiety of discontent. The superiority of a highly civilised man lies
        chiefly in the fact that he belongs to a higher order of being, for
        he has approached more nearly to the end of his existence, and has
        called into action a larger number of his capacities. And this is in
        itself an end. Even if, as is not improbable, the lower animals are
        happier than man,<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href=
        "#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a> and
        semi-barbarians than civilised men, still it is better to be a man
        than a brute, better to be born amid the fierce struggles of
        civilisation than in some stranded nation apart from all the flow of
        enterprise and knowledge. Even in that material civilisation which
        utilitarianism delights to glorify, there is an element which the
        philosophy of mere enjoyment cannot explain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Again, if we ask
        the reason of the vast and indisputable superiority which the general
        voice of mankind gives to mental pleasures, considered as pleasures,
        over physical ones, we shall find, I think, no adequate or
        satisfactory answer on the supposition that pleasures owe all their
        value to the quantity of enjoyment they afford. The former, it is
        truly said, are more varied and more prolonged than the latter but on
        the other hand, they are attained with more effort, and they are
        diffused over a far narrower circle. No one who compares the class of
        men who derive their pleasure chiefly from field sports or other
        forms of physical enjoyment with those who derive their pleasure from
        the highest intellectual sources; no one who compares the period of
        boyhood when enjoyments are chiefly animal with early <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> manhood when they are chiefly
        intellectual, will be able to discover in the different levels of
        happiness any justification of the great interval the world places
        between these pleasures. No painter or novelist, who wished to depict
        an ideal of perfect happiness, would seek it in a profound student.
        Without entering into any doubtful questions concerning the relations
        of the body to all mental states, it may be maintained that bodily
        conditions have in general more influence upon our enjoyment than
        mental ones. The happiness of the great majority of men is far more
        affected by health and by temperament,<a id="noteref_109" name=
        "noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>
        resulting from physical conditions, which again physical enjoyments
        are often calculated to produce, than by any mental or moral causes,
        and acute physical sufferings paralyse all the energies of our nature
        to a greater extent than any mental distress. It is probable that the
        American inventor of the first anæsthetic has done more for the real
        happiness of mankind than all the moral philosophers from Socrates to
        Mill. Moral causes may teach men patience, and the endurance of felt
        suffering, or may even alleviate its pangs, but there are
        temperaments due to physical <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> causes from which most sufferings glance almost
        unfelt. It is said that when an ancient was asked <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“what use is philosophy?”</span> he answered,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“it teaches men how to die,”</span> and he
        verified his words by a noble death; but it has been proved on a
        thousand battle-fields, it has been proved on a thousand scaffolds,
        it is proved through all the wide regions of China and India, that
        the dull and animal nature which feels little and realises faintly,
        can meet death with a calm that philosophy can barely rival.<a id=
        "noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a> The
        truth is, that the mental part of our nature is not regarded as
        superior to the physical part, because it contributes most to our
        happiness. The superiority is of a different kind, and may be
        intelligibly expressed by the epithets higher and lower.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, once more,
        there is a class of pleasures resulting from the gratification of our
        moral feelings which we naturally place in the foremost rank. To the
        great majority of mankind it will probably appear, in spite of the
        doctrine of Paley, that no multiple of the pleasure of eating pastry
        can be an equivalent to the pleasure derived from a generous action.
        It is not that the latter is so inconceivably intense. It is that it
        is of a higher order.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This distinction
        of kind has been neglected or denied by most utilitarian
        writers;<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href=
        "#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        although an attempt has recently <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> been made to introduce it into the system, it
        appears manifestly incompatible with its principle. If the reality of
        the distinction be admitted, it shows that our wills are so far from
        tending necessarily to that which produces most enjoyment that we
        have the power even in our pleasures of recognising a higher and a
        wholly different quality, and of making that quality rather than
        enjoyment the object of our choice. If it be possible for a man in
        choosing between two pleasures deliberately to select as preferable,
        apart from all consideration of consequences, that which he is
        conscious gives least enjoyment <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> because he recognises in it a greater
        worthiness, or elevation, it is certain that his conduct is either
        wholly irrational, or that he is acting on a principle of judgment
        for which 'the greatest happiness' philosophy is unable to account.
        Consistently with that philosophy, the terms higher and lower as
        applied to different parts of our nature, to different regions of
        thought or feeling, can have no other meaning than that of productive
        of more or less enjoyment. But if once we admit a distinction of
        quality as well as a distinction of quantity in our estimate of
        pleasure, all is changed. It then appears evident that the different
        parts of our nature to which these pleasures refer, bear to each
        other a relation of another kind, which may be clearly and justly
        described by the terms higher and lower; and the assertion that our
        reason reveals to us intuitively and directly this hierarchy of our
        being, is a fundamental position of the greatest schools of intuitive
        moralists. According to these writers, when we say that our moral and
        intellectual is superior to our animal nature, that the benevolent
        affections are superior to the selfish ones, that conscience has a
        legitimate supremacy over the other parts of our being; this language
        is not arbitrary, or fantastic, or capricious, because it is
        intelligible. When such a subordination is announced, it corresponds
        with feelings we all possess, falls in with the natural course of our
        judgments, with our habitual and unstudied language.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The arguments that
        have been directed against the theory of natural moral perceptions
        are of two kinds, the first, which I have already noticed, being
        designed to show that all our moral judgments may be resolved into
        considerations of utility; the second resting upon the diversity of
        these judgments in different nations and stages of civilisation,
        which, it is said, is altogether inexplicable upon the supposition of
        a moral faculty. As these variations form the great stumbling-block
        in the way of the doctrine I am maintaining, and as they <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> constitute a very important part of the
        history of morals, I shall make no apology for noticing them in some
        detail.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, there are many cases in which diversities of moral judgment
        arise from causes that are not moral, but purely intellectual. Thus,
        for example, when theologians pronounced loans at interest contrary
        to the law of nature and plainly extortionate, this error obviously
        arose from a false notion of the uses of money. They believed that it
        was a sterile thing, and that he who has restored what he borrowed,
        has cancelled all the benefit he received from the transaction. At
        the time when the first Christian moralists treated the subject,
        special circumstances had rendered the rate of interest extremely
        high, and consequently extremely oppressive to the poor, and this
        fact, no doubt, strengthened the prejudice; but the root of the
        condemnation of usury was simply an error in political economy. When
        men came to understand that money is a productive thing, and that the
        sum lent enables the borrower to create sources of wealth that will
        continue when the loan has been returned, they perceived that there
        was no natural injustice in exacting payment for this advantage, and
        usury either ceased to be assailed, or was assailed only upon the
        ground of positive commands.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus again the
        question of the criminality of abortion has been considerably
        affected by physiological speculations as to the time when the fœtus
        in the womb acquires the nature, and therefore the rights, of a
        separate being. The general opinion among the ancients seems to have
        been that it was but a part of the mother, and that she had the same
        right to destroy it as to cauterise a tumour upon her body. Plato and
        Aristotle both admitted the practice. The Roman law contained no
        enactment against voluntary abortion till the time of Ulpian. The
        Stoics thought that the infant received its soul when respiration
        began. The Justinian code fixed its animation at forty days after
        conception. In modern <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg
        093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        legislations it is treated as a distinct being from the moment of
        conception.<a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href=
        "#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> It is
        obvious that the solution of such questions, though affecting our
        moral judgments, must be sought entirely outside the range of moral
        feelings.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        there is a broad distinction to be drawn between duties which rest
        immediately on the dictates of conscience, and those which are based
        upon positive commands. The iniquity of theft, murder, falsehood, or
        adultery rests upon grounds generically distinct from those on which
        men pronounce it to be sinful to eat meat on Friday, or to work on
        Sunday, or to abstain from religious assemblies. The reproaches
        conscience directs against those who are guilty of these last acts
        are purely hypothetical, conscience enjoining obedience to the Divine
        commands, but leaving it to reason to determine what those commands
        may be. The distinction between these two classes of duties becomes
        apparent on the slightest reflection, and the variations in their
        relative prominence form one of the most important branches of
        religious history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Closely connected
        with the preceding are the diversities which result from an ancient
        custom becoming at last, through its very antiquity, or through the
        confusion of means with ends, an object of religious reverence. Among
        the many safeguards of female purity in the Roman republic was an
        enactment forbidding women even to taste wine, and this very
        intelligible law being enforced with the earliest education, became
        at last, by habit and traditionary reverence, so incorporated with
        the moral feelings of the people, that its violation was spoken of as
        a monstrous crime. Aulus Gellius has preserved a passage in which
        Cato observes, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the husband has an
        absolute authority over his wife; it is for him to condemn and punish
        her, if she has been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg
        094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        guilty of any shameful act, such as drinking wine or committing
        adultery.”</span><a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href=
        "#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> As soon
        as the reverence for tradition was diminished, and men ventured to
        judge old customs upon their own merits, they were able, by steadily
        reflecting upon this belief, to reduce it to its primitive elements,
        to separate the act from the ideas with which it had been associated,
        and thus to perceive that it was not necessarily opposed to any of
        those great moral laws or feelings which their consciences revealed,
        and which were the basis of all their reasonings on morals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A confused
        association of ideas, which is easily exposed by a patient analysis,
        lies at the root of more serious anomalies. Thus to those who reflect
        deeply upon moral history, few things, I suppose, are more
        humiliating than to contrast the admiration and profoundly
        reverential attachment excited by a conqueror, who through the
        promptings of simple vanity, through love of fame, or through greed
        of territory, has wantonly caused the deaths, the sufferings, or the
        bereavements <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg
        095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        thousands, with the abhorrence produced by a single act of murder or
        robbery committed by a poor and ignorant man, perhaps under the
        pressure of extreme want or intolerable wrong. The attraction of
        genius and power, which the vulgar usually measure by their material
        fruits, the advantages acquired by the nation to which he belongs,
        the belief that battles are decided by providential interference, and
        that military success is therefore a proof of Divine favour, and the
        sanctity ascribed to the regal office, have all no doubt conspired to
        veil the atrocity of the conqueror's career; but there is probably
        another and a deeper influence behind. That which invests war, in
        spite of all the evils that attend it, with a certain moral grandeur,
        is the heroic self-sacrifice it elicits. With perhaps the single
        exception of the Church, it is the sphere in which mercenary motives
        have least sway, in which performance is least weighed and measured
        by strict obligation, in which a disinterested enthusiasm has most
        scope. A battle-field is the scene of deeds of self-sacrifice so
        transcendent, and at the same time so dramatic, that in spite of all
        its horrors and crimes, it awakens the most passionate moral
        enthusiasm. But this feeling produced by the thought of so many who
        have sacrificed their life-blood for their flag or for their chief,
        needs some definite object on which to rest. The multitude of
        nameless combatants do not strike the imagination. They do not stand
        out, and are not realised, as distinct and living figures conspicuous
        to the view. Hence it is that the chief, as the most prominent,
        becomes the representative warrior; the martyr's aureole descends
        upon his brow, and thus by a confusion that seems the very irony of
        fate, the enthusiasm evoked by the self-sacrifice of thousands sheds
        a sacred glow around the very man whose prodigious egotism had
        rendered that sacrifice necessary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another form of
        moral paradox is derived from the fact that positive religions may
        override our moral perceptions in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page096">[pg 096]</span><a name="Pg096" id="Pg096" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> such a manner, that we may consciously admit a
        moral contradiction. In this respect there is a strict parallelism
        between our intellectual and our moral faculties. It is at present
        the professed belief of at least three-fourths of the Christian
        Church, and was for some centuries the firm belief of the entire
        Church, that on a certain night the Founder of the Christian faith,
        being seated at a supper table, held His own body in His own hand,
        broke that body, distributed it to His disciples, who proceeded to
        eat it, the same body remaining at the same moment seated intact at
        the table, and soon afterwards proceeding to the garden of
        Gethsemane. The fact of such a doctrine being believed, does not
        imply that the faculties of those who hold it are of such a nature
        that they perceive no contradiction or natural absurdity in these
        statements. The well-known argument derived from the obscurity of the
        metaphysical notion of substance is intended only in some slight
        degree to soften the difficulty. The contradiction is clearly
        perceived, but it is accepted by faith as part of the teaching of the
        Church.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What
        transubstantiation is in the order of reason the Augustinian doctrine
        of the damnation of unbaptised infants, and the Calvinistic doctrine
        of reprobation, are in the order of morals. Of these doctrines it is
        not too much to say, that in the form in which they have often been
        stated, they surpass in atrocity any tenets that have ever been
        admitted into any pagan creed, and would, if they formed an essential
        part of Christianity, amply justify the term <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“pernicious superstition,”</span> which Tacitus applied
        to the faith. That a little child who lives but a few moments after
        birth and dies before it has been sprinkled with the sacred water is
        in such a sense responsible for its ancestors having 6,000 years
        before eaten some forbidden fruit that it may with perfect justice be
        resuscitated and cast into an abyss of eternal fire in expiation of
        this ancestral crime, that an all-righteous and all-merciful Creator
        in the full exercise of those attributes deliberately <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> calls into existence sentient beings whom
        He has from eternity irrevocably destined to endless, unspeakable,
        unmitigated torture, are propositions which are at once so
        extravagantly absurd and so ineffably atrocious that their adoption
        might well lead men to doubt the universality of moral perceptions.
        Such teaching is in fact simply dæmonism, and dæmonism in its most
        extreme form. It attributes to the Creator acts of injustice and of
        barbarity, which it would be absolutely impossible for the
        imagination to surpass, acts before which the most monstrous excesses
        of human cruelty dwindle into insignificance, acts which are in fact
        considerably worse than any that theologians have attributed to the
        devil. If there were men who while vividly realising the nature of
        these acts naturally turned to them as the exhibitions of perfect
        goodness, all systems of ethics founded upon innate moral perceptions
        would be false. But happily this is not so. Those who embrace these
        doctrines do so only because they believe that some inspired Church
        or writer has taught them, and because they are still in that stage
        in which men consider it more irreligious to question the
        infallibility of an apostle than to disfigure by any conceivable
        imputation the character of the Deity. They accordingly esteem it a
        matter of duty, and a commendable exercise of humility, to stifle the
        moral feelings of their nature, and they at last succeed in
        persuading themselves that their Divinity would be extremely offended
        if they hesitated to ascribe to him the attributes of a fiend. But
        their moral feelings, though not unimpaired by such conceptions, are
        not on ordinary subjects generically different from those of their
        neighbours. With an amiable inconsistency they can even find
        something to revolt them in the lives of a Caligula or a Nero. Their
        theological estimate of justice and mercy is isolated. Their doctrine
        is accepted as a kind of moral miracle, and as is customary with a
        certain school of theologians, when they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> enunciate a proposition which is palpably
        self-contradictory they call it a mystery and an occasion for
        faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this instance a
        distinct moral contradiction is consciously admitted. In the case of
        persecution, a strictly moral and logical inference is drawn from a
        very immoral proposition which is accepted as part of a system of
        dogmatic theology. The two elements that should be considered in
        punishing a criminal are the heinousness of his guilt and the injury
        he inflicts. When the greatest guilt and the greatest injury are
        combined, the greatest punishment naturally follows. No one would
        argue against the existence of a moral faculty, on the ground that
        men put murderers to death. When therefore theologians believed that
        a man was intensely guilty who held certain opinions, and that he was
        causing the damnation of his fellows if he propagated them, there was
        no moral difficulty in concluding that the heretic should be put to
        death. Selfish considerations may have directed persecution against
        heresy rather than against vice, but the Catholic doctrines of the
        guilt of error, and of the infallibility of the Church, were amply
        sufficient to justify it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears then
        that a dogmatic system which is accepted on rational or other
        grounds, and supported by prospects of rewards and punishments, may
        teach a code of ethics differing from that of conscience; and that in
        this case the voice of conscience may be either disregarded or
        stifled. It is however also true, that it may be perverted. When, for
        example, theologians during a long period have inculcated habits of
        credulity, rather than habits of enquiry; when they have persuaded
        men that it is better to cherish prejudice than to analyse it; better
        to stifle every doubt of what they have been taught than honestly to
        investigate its value, they will at last succeed in forming habits of
        mind that will instinctively and habitually recoil from all
        impartiality and intellectual honesty. If men continually violate a
        duty they may at last cease to feel its obligation. But this, though
        it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name=
        "Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> forms a great
        difficulty in ethical enquiries, is no argument against the reality
        of moral perceptions, for it is simply a law to which all our powers
        are subject. A bad intellectual education will produce not only
        erroneous or imperfect information but also a false ply or habit of
        judgment. A bad æsthetical education will produce false canons of
        taste. Systematic abuse will pervert and vitiate even some of our
        physical perceptions. In each case the experience of many minds under
        many conditions must be appealed to, to determine the standard of
        right and wrong, and long and difficult discipline is required to
        restore the diseased organ to sanity. We may decide particular moral
        questions by reasoning, but our reasoning is an appeal to certain
        moral principles which are revealed to us by intuition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The principal
        difficulty I imagine which most men have in admitting that we possess
        certain natural moral perceptions arises from the supposition that it
        implies the existence of some mysterious agent like the dæmon of
        Socrates, which gives us specific and infallible information in
        particular cases. But this I conceive to be a complete mistake. All
        that is necessarily meant by the adherents of this school is
        comprised in two propositions. The first is that our will is not
        governed exclusively by the law of pleasure and pain, but also by the
        law of duty, which we feel to be distinct from the former, and to
        carry with it the sense of obligation. The second is that the basis
        of our conception of duty is an intuitive perception that among the
        various feelings, tendencies, and impulses that constitute our
        emotional being, there are some which are essentially good, and ought
        to be encouraged, and some which are essentially bad, and ought to be
        repressed. They contend that it is a psychological fact that we are
        intuitively conscious that our benevolent affections are superior to
        our malevolent ones, truth to falsehood, justice to injustice,
        gratitude to ingratitude, chastity to sensuality, and that in all
        ages and countries the path of virtue has been towards <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page100">[pg 100]</span><a name="Pg100" id="Pg100"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the higher and not towards the lower
        feelings. It may be that the sense of duty is so weak as to be
        scarcely perceptible, and then the lower part of our nature will be
        supreme. It may happen that certain conditions of society lead men to
        direct their anxiety for moral improvement altogether in one or two
        channels, as was the case in ancient Greece, where civic and
        intellectual virtues were very highly cultivated, and the virtue of
        chastity was almost neglected. It may happen that different parts of
        our higher nature in a measure conflict, as when a very strong sense
        of justice checks our benevolent feelings. Dogmatic systems may
        enjoin men to propitiate certain unseen beings by acts which are not
        in accordance with the moral law. Special circumstances may
        influence, and the intermingling of many different motives may
        obscure and complicate, the moral evolution; but above all these one
        great truth appears. No one who desires to become holier and better
        imagines that he does so by becoming more malevolent, or more
        untruthful, or more unchaste. Every one who desires to attain
        perfection in these departments of feeling is impelled towards
        benevolence, towards veracity, towards chastity.<a id="noteref_114"
        name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it is manifest
        that according to this theory the moral unity to be expected in
        different ages is not a unity of standard, or of acts, but a unity of
        tendency. Men come into the world with their benevolent affections
        very inferior in power to their selfish ones, and the function of
        morals is to invert this order. The extinction of all selfish feeling
        is impossible for an individual, and if it were general, it would
        result in the dissolution of society. The question of morals must
        always be a question of proportion or of degree. At <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> one time the benevolent affections
        embrace merely the family, soon the circle expanding includes first a
        class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity,
        and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man with the
        animal world. In each of these stages a standard is formed, different
        from that of the preceding stage, but in each case the same tendency
        is recognised as virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have in this
        fact a simple, and as it appears to me a conclusive, answer to the
        overwhelming majority of the objections that are continually and
        confidently urged against the intuitive school. That some savages
        kill their old parents, that infanticide has been practised without
        compunction by even civilised nations, that the best Romans saw
        nothing wrong in the gladiatorial shows, that political or revengeful
        assassinations have been for centuries admitted, that slavery has
        been sometimes honoured and sometimes condemned, are unquestionable
        proofs that the same act may be regarded in one age as innocent, and
        in another as criminal. Now it is undoubtedly true that in many cases
        an historical examination will reveal special circumstances,
        explaining or palliating the apparent anomaly. It has been often
        shown that the gladiatorial shows were originally a form of human
        sacrifice adopted through religious motives; that the rude nomadic
        life of savages rendering impossible the preservation of aged and
        helpless members of the tribe, the murder of parents was regarded as
        an act of mercy both by the murderer and the victim; that before an
        effective administration of justice was organised, private vengeance
        was the sole preservative against crime,<a id="noteref_115" name=
        "noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> and
        political assassination against usurpation; that the insensibility of
        some savages to the criminality of theft arises from the fact that
        they were accustomed to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg
        102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have all things in common; that the Spartan law, legalising theft,
        arose partly from a desire to foster military dexterity among the
        people, but chiefly from a desire to discourage wealth; that slavery
        was introduced through motives of mercy, to prevent conquerors from
        killing their prisoners.<a id="noteref_116" name="noteref_116" href=
        "#note_116"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">116</span></span></a> All
        this is true, but there is another and a more general answer. It is
        not to be expected, and it is not maintained, that men in all ages
        should have agreed about the application of their moral principles.
        All that is contended for is that these principles are themselves the
        same. Some of what appear to us monstrous acts of cruelty, were
        dictated by that very feeling of humanity, the universal perception
        of the merit of which they are cited to disprove,<a id="noteref_117"
        name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> and
        even when this is not the case, all that can be inferred is, that the
        standard of humanity was very low. But still humanity was recognised
        as a virtue, and cruelty as a vice.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point, I
        may observe how completely fallacious is the assertion that a
        progressive morality is impossible upon the supposition of an
        original moral faculty.<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href=
        "#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a> To such
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103"
        id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> statements there are two very
        simple answers. In the first place, although the intuitive moralist
        asserts that certain qualities are necessarily virtuous, he fully
        admits that the degree in which they are acted upon, or in other
        words, the standard of duty, may become progressively higher. In the
        next place, although he refuses to resolve all virtue into utility,
        he admits as fully as his opponents, that benevolence, or the
        promotion of the happiness of man, is a virtue, and that therefore
        discoveries which exhibit more clearly the true interests of our
        kind, may throw new light upon the nature of our duty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The considerations
        I have urged with reference to humanity, apply with equal force to
        the various relations of the sexes. When the passions of men are
        altogether unrestrained, community of wives and all eccentric forms
        of sensuality will be admitted. When men seek to improve their nature
        in this respect, their object will be to abridge and confine the
        empire of sensuality. But to this process of improvement there are
        obvious limits. In the first place the continuance of the species is
        only possible by a sensual act. In the next place the strength of
        this passion and the weakness of humanity are so great, that the
        moralist must take into account the fact that in all societies, and
        especially in those in which free scope had long been given to the
        passions, a large amount of indulgence will arise which is not due to
        a simple desire of propagating the species. If then incest is
        prohibited, and community of wives replaced by ordinary polygamy, a
        moral improvement will have been effected, and a standard of virtue
        formed. But this standard soon becomes the starting-point of new
        progress. If we examine the Jewish law, we find the legislator
        prohibiting adultery, regulating the degrees <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page104">[pg 104]</span><a name="Pg104" id="Pg104" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of marriage, but at the same time authorising
        polygamy, though with a caution against the excessive multiplication
        of wives. In Greece monogamy, though not without exceptions, had been
        enforced, but a concurrence of unfavourable influences prevented any
        high standard being attained among the men, and in their case almost
        every form of indulgence beyond the limits of marriage was permitted.
        In Rome the standard was far higher. Monogamy was firmly established.
        The ideal of female morality was placed as high as among Christian
        nations. Among men, however, while unnatural love and adultery were
        regarded as wrong, simple unchastity before marriage was scarcely
        considered a fault. In Catholicism marriage is regarded in a twofold
        light, as a means for the propagation of the species, and as a
        concession to the weakness of humanity, and all other sensual
        enjoyment is stringently prohibited.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these cases
        there is a great difference between the degrees of earnestness with
        which men exert themselves in the repression of their passions, and
        in the amount of indulgence which is conceded to their lower
        nature;<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href=
        "#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> but
        there is no difference in the direction of the virtuous impulse.
        While, too, in the case of adultery, and in the production of
        children, questions of interest and utility do undoubtedly intervene,
        we are conscious that the general progress turns upon a totally
        different order of ideas. The feeling of all men and the language of
        all nations, the sentiment which though often weakened is never
        wholly effaced, that this appetite, even in its most legitimate
        gratification, is a thing to be veiled and withdrawn from sight, all
        that is known under the names of decency and indecency, concur in
        proving that we have an innate, intuitive, instinctive perception
        that there is something degrading in the sensual part of our nature,
        something <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page105">[pg
        105]</span><a name="Pg105" id="Pg105" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        which a feeling of shame is naturally attached, something that jars
        with our conception of perfect purity, something we could not with
        any propriety ascribe to an all-holy being. It may be questioned
        whether anyone was ever altogether destitute of this perception, and
        nothing but the most inveterate passion for system could induce men
        to resolve it into a mere calculation of interests. It is this
        feeling or instinct which lies at the root of the whole movement I
        have described, and it is this too that produced that sense of the
        sanctity of perfect continence which the Catholic church has so
        warmly encouraged, but which may be traced through the most distant
        ages, and the most various creeds. We find it among the Nazarenes and
        Essenes of Judæa, among the priests of Egypt and India, in the
        monasteries of Tartary, in the histories of miraculous virgins that
        are so numerous in the mythologies of Asia. Such, for example, was
        the Chinese legend that tells how when there was but one man with one
        woman upon earth, the woman refused to sacrifice her virginity even
        in order to people the globe, and the gods honouring her purity
        granted that she should conceive beneath the gaze of her lover's
        eyes, and a virgin-mother became the parent of humanity.<a id=
        "noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a> In the
        midst of the sensuality of ancient Greece, chastity was the
        pre-eminent attribute of sanctity ascribed to Athene and Artemis.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Chaste daughter of Zeus,”</span> prayed the
        suppliants in Æschylus, <span class="tei tei-q">“thou whose calm eye
        is never troubled, look down upon us! Virgin, defend the
        virgins.”</span> The Parthenon, or virgin's temple, was the noblest
        religious edifice of Athens. Celibacy was an essential condition in a
        few of the orders of priests, and in several orders of priestesses.
        Plato based his moral system upon the distinction between the bodily
        or sensual, and the spiritual or rational part of our nature, the
        first being the sign of our degradation, and the second of our
        dignity. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page106">[pg
        106]</span><a name="Pg106" id="Pg106" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        whole school of Pythagoras made chastity one of its leading virtues,
        and even laboured for the creation of a monastic system. The
        conception of the celestial Aphrodite, the uniter of souls, unsullied
        by the taint of matter, lingered side by side with that of the
        earthly Aphrodite or patroness of lust, and if there was a time when
        the sculptors sought to pander to the excesses of passion there was
        another in which all their art was displayed in refining and
        idealising it. Strabo mentions the existence in Thrace of societies
        of men aspiring to perfection by celibacy and austere lives. Plutarch
        applauds certain philosophers who vowed to abstain for a year from
        wine and women in order <span class="tei tei-q">“to honour God by
        their continence.”</span><a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a> In Rome
        the religious reverence was concentrated more especially upon married
        life. The great prominence accorded to the Penates was the religious
        sanction of domesticity. So too, at first, was the worship so popular
        among the Roman women of the Bona Dea—the ideal wife who according to
        the legend had, when on earth, never looked in the face or known the
        name of any man but her husband.<a id="noteref_122" name=
        "noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“For altar and hearth”</span> was the
        rallying cry of the Roman soldier. But above all this we find the
        traces of a higher ideal. We find it in the intense sanctity
        attributed to the vestal virgins whose continence was guarded by such
        fearful penalties, and supposed to be so closely linked with the
        prosperity of the state, whose prayer was believed to possess a
        miraculous power, and who were permitted to drive through the streets
        of Rome at a time when that privilege was refused even to the
        Empress.<a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href=
        "#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> We find
        it in the legend of Claudia, who, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page107">[pg 107]</span><a name="Pg107" id="Pg107" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> when the ship bearing the image of the mother
        of the gods had been stranded in the Tiber, attached her girdle to
        its prow, and vindicated her challenged chastity by drawing with her
        virgin hand, the ponderous mass which strong men had sought in vain
        to move. We find it in the prophetic gift so often attributed to
        virgins,<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href=
        "#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a> In
        Christianity one great source of the attraction of the faith has been
        the ascription of virginity to its female ideal. The Catholic
        monastic system has been so constructed as to draw many thousands
        from the sphere of active duty; its irrevocable vows have doubtless
        led to much suffering and not a little crime; its opposition to the
        normal development of our mingled nature has often resulted in grave
        aberrations of the imagination, and it has placed its ban upon
        domestic affections and sympathies which have a very high moral
        value; but in its central conception that the purely animal side
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108"
        id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of our being is a low and a
        degraded side, it reflects, I believe, with perfect fidelity the
        feelings of our nature.<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href=
        "#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these
        considerations some others of a different nature may be added. It is
        not true that some ancient nations regarded polygamy as good in the
        same sense as others regarded chastity. There is a great difference
        between deeming a state permissible and proposing it as a condition
        of sanctity. If Mohammedans people paradise with images of
        sensuality, it is not because these form their ideal of holiness. It
        is because they regard earth as the sphere of virtue, heaven as that
        of simple enjoyment. If some pagan nations deified sensuality, this
        was simply because the deification of the forces of nature, of which
        the prolific energy is one of the most conspicuous, is among the
        earliest forms of religion, and long precedes the identification of
        the Deity with a moral ideal.<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128"
        href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a> If
        there have <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg
        109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        been nations who attached a certain stigma to virginity, this has not
        been because they esteemed sensuality intrinsically holier than
        chastity; but because a scanty, warlike people whose position in the
        world depends chiefly on the number of its warriors, will naturally
        make it its main object to encourage population. This was especially
        the case with the ancient Jews, who always regarded extreme
        populousness as indissolubly connected with national prosperity,
        whose religion was essentially patriotic, and among whom the
        possibility of becoming an ancestor of the Messiah had imparted a
        peculiar dignity to childbirth. Yet even among the Jews the Essenes
        regarded virginity as the ideal of sanctity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader will
        now be in a position to perceive the utter futility of the objections
        which from the time of Locke have been continually brought against
        the theory of natural moral perceptions, upon the ground that some
        actions which were admitted as lawful in one age, have been regarded
        as immoral in another. All these become absolutely worthless when it
        is perceived that in every age virtue has consisted in the
        cultivation of the same feelings, though the standards of excellence
        attained have been different. The terms higher and lower, nobler or
        less noble, purer or less pure, represent moral facts with much
        greater fidelity than the terms right or wrong, or virtue or vice.
        There is a certain sense in which moral distinctions are absolute and
        immutable. There is another sense in which they are altogether
        relative and transient. There are some acts which are so manifestly
        and grossly opposed to our moral feelings, that they are regarded as
        wrong in the very earliest stages of the cultivation of these
        feelings. There are distinctions, such as that between truth and
        falsehood, which from their nature assume at once a sharpness of
        definition that separates them from mere <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> virtues of degree, though even in these cases
        there are wide variations in the amount of scrupulosity that is in
        different periods required. But apart from positive commands, the
        sole external rule enabling men to designate acts, not simply as
        better or worse, but as positively right or wrong, is, I conceive,
        the standard of society; not an arbitrary standard like that which
        Mandeville imagined, but the level which society has attained in the
        cultivation of what our moral faculty tells us is the higher or
        virtuous part of our nature. He who falls below this is obstructing
        the tendency which is the essence of virtue. He who merely attains
        this, may not be justified in his own conscience, or in other words,
        by the standard of his own moral development, but as far as any
        external rule is concerned, he has done his duty. He who rises above
        this has entered into the region of things which it is virtuous to
        do, but not vicious to neglect—a region known among Catholic
        theologians by the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“counsels of
        perfection.”</span> No discussions, I conceive, can be more idle than
        whether slavery, or the slaughter of prisoners in war, or
        gladiatorial shows, or polygamy, are essentially wrong. They may be
        wrong now—they were not so once—and when an ancient countenanced by
        his example one or other of these, he was not committing a crime. The
        unchangeable proposition for which we contend is this—that
        benevolence is always a virtuous disposition—that the sensual part of
        our nature is always the lower part.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point,
        however, a very difficult problem naturally arises. Admitting that
        our moral nature is superior to our intellectual or physical nature,
        admitting, too, that by the constitution of our being we perceive
        ourselves to be under an obligation to develope our nature to its
        perfection, establishing the supreme ascendency of moral motives, the
        question still remains whether the disparity between the different
        parts of our being is such that no material or intellectual
        advantage, however great, may be rightly purchased <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page111">[pg 111]</span><a name="Pg111" id="Pg111"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by any sacrifice of our moral nature,
        however small. This is the great question of casuistry, the question
        which divines express by asking whether the end ever justifies the
        means; and on this subject there exists among theologians a doctrine
        which is absolutely unrealised, which no one ever dreams of applying
        to actual life, but of which it may be truly said that though
        propounded with the best intentions, it would, if acted upon, be
        utterly incompatible with the very rudiments of civilisation. It is
        said that an undoubted sin, even the most trivial, is a thing in its
        essence and in its consequences so unspeakably dreadful, that no
        conceivable material or intellectual advantage can counterbalance it;
        that rather than it should be committed, it would be better that any
        amount of calamity which did not bring with it sin should be endured,
        even that the whole human race should perish in agonies.<a id=
        "noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> If this
        be the case, it is manifest that the supreme object of humanity
        should be sinlessness, and it is equally manifest that the means to
        this end is the absolute suppression of the desires. To expand the
        circle of wants is necessarily to multiply temptations, and therefore
        to increase the number of sins. It may indeed elevate the moral
        standard, for a torpid sinlessness is not a high moral condition; but
        if every sin be what these theologians assert, if it be a thing
        deserving eternal agony, and so inconceivably frightful that the ruin
        of a world is a less evil than its commission, even moral advantages
        are utterly incommensurate with it. No heightening of the moral tone,
        no depth or ecstasy of devotion, can for a moment be placed in the
        balance. The consequences of this doctrine, if applied to actual
        life, would be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg
        112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> so
        extravagant, that their simple statement is a refutation. A
        sovereign, when calculating the consequences of a war, should reflect
        that a single sin occasioned by that war, a single blasphemy of a
        wounded soldier, the robbery of a single hencoop, the violation of
        the purity of a single woman, is a greater calamity than the ruin of
        the entire commerce of his nation, the loss of her most precious
        provinces, the destruction of all her power. He must believe that the
        evil of the increase of unchastity, which invariably results from the
        formation of an army, is an immeasurably greater calamity than any
        material or political disasters that army can possibly avert. He must
        believe that the most fearful plague or famine that desolates his
        land should be regarded as a matter of rejoicing, if it has but the
        feeblest and most transient influence in repressing vice. He must
        believe that if the agglomeration of his people in great cities adds
        but one to the number of their sins, no possible intellectual or
        material advantages can prevent the construction of cities being a
        fearful calamity. According to this principle, every elaboration of
        life, every amusement that brings multitudes together, almost every
        art, every accession of wealth that awakens or stimulates desires, is
        an evil, for all these become the sources of some sins, and their
        advantages are for the most part purely terrestrial. The entire
        structure of civilisation is founded upon the belief that it is a
        good thing to cultivate intellectual and material capacities, even at
        the cost of certain moral evils which we are often able accurately to
        foresee.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href=
        "#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a> The
        time may come when the man who lays the foundation-stone of a
        manufacture will be able to predict with assurance in what proportion
        the drunkenness and the unchastity of his city will be increased by
        his enterprise. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg
        113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Yet
        he will still pursue that enterprise, and mankind will pronounce it
        to be good.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theological
        doctrine on the subject, considered in its full stringency, though
        professed by many, is, as I have said, realised and consistently
        acted on by no one; but the practical judgments of mankind concerning
        the extent of the superiority of moral over all other interests vary
        greatly, and this variation supplies one of the most serious
        objections to intuitive moralists. The nearest practical approach to
        the theological estimate of a sin may be found in the ranks of the
        ascetics. Their whole system rests upon the belief that it is a thing
        so transcendently dreadful as to bear no proportion or appreciable
        relation to any earthly interests. Starting from this belief, the
        ascetic makes it the exclusive object of his life to avoid sinning.
        He accordingly abstains from all the active business of society,
        relinquishes all worldly aims and ambitions, dulls by continued
        discipline his natural desires, and endeavours to pass a life of
        complete absorption in religious exercises. And in all this his
        conduct is reasonable and consistent. The natural course of every man
        who adopts this estimate of the enormity of sin is at every cost to
        avoid all external influences that can prove temptations, and to
        attenuate as far as possible his own appetites and emotions. It is in
        this respect that the exaggerations of theologians paralyse our moral
        being. For the diminution of sins, however important, is but one part
        of moral progress. Whenever it is forced into a disproportionate
        prominence, we find tame, languid, and mutilated natures, destitute
        of all fire and energy, and this tendency has been still further
        aggravated by the extreme prominence usually given to the virtue of
        gentleness, which may indeed be attained by men of strong natures and
        vehement emotions, but is evidently more congenial to a somewhat
        feeble and passionless character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ascetic practices
        are manifestly and rapidly disappearing, and their decline is a
        striking proof of the evanescence of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the moral notions of which they were the
        expression, but in many existing questions relating to the same
        matter, we find perplexing diversity of judgment. We find it in the
        contrast between the system of education usually adopted by the
        Catholic priesthood, which has for its pre-eminent object to prevent
        sins, and for its means a constant and minute supervision, and the
        English system of public schools, which is certainly not the most
        fitted to guard against the possibility of sin, or to foster any very
        delicate scrupulosity of feeling; but is intended, and popularly
        supposed, to secure the healthy expansion of every variety of
        capacity. We find it in the widely different attitudes which good men
        in different periods have adopted towards religious opinions they
        believe to be false; some, like the reformers, refusing to
        participate in any superstitious service, or to withhold on any
        occasion, or at any cost, their protest against what they regarded as
        a lie; others, like most ancient, and some modern philosophers and
        politicians, combining the most absolute personal incredulity with an
        assiduous observance of superstitious rites, and strongly censuring
        those who disturbed delusions which are useful or consolatory to the
        people; while a third class silently, but without protest, withdraw
        themselves from the observances, and desire that their opinions
        should have a free expression in literature, but at the same time
        discourage all proselytising efforts to force them rudely on
        unprepared minds. We find it in the frequent conflicts between the
        political economist and the Catholic priest on the subject of early
        marriages, the former opposing them on the ground that it is an
        essential condition of material well-being that the standard of
        comfort should not be depressed, the latter advocating them on the
        ground that the postponement of marriages, through prudential
        motives, by any large body of men, is the fertile mother of sin. We
        find it most conspicuously in the marked diversities of tolerance
        manifested in different communities towards amusements which may in
        themselves be perfectly innocent, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> but which prove the sources or the occasions of
        vice. The Scotch Puritans probably represent one extreme, the
        Parisian society of the empire the other, while the position of
        average Englishmen is perhaps equidistant between them. Yet this
        difference, great as it is, is a difference not of principle, but of
        degree. No Puritan seriously desires to suppress every
        clan-gathering, every highland game which may have occasioned an
        isolated fit of drunkenness, though he may be unable to show that it
        has prevented any sin that would otherwise have been committed. No
        Frenchman will question that there is a certain amount of
        demoralisation which should not be tolerated, however great the
        enjoyment that accompanies it. Yet the one dwells almost exclusively
        upon the moral, the other upon the attractive, nature of a spectacle.
        Between these there are numerous gradations, which are shown in
        frequent disputes about the merits and demerits of the racecourse,
        the ball, the theatre, and the concert. Where then, it may be asked,
        is the line to be drawn? By what rule can the point be determined at
        which an amusement becomes vitiated by the evil of its
        consequences?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these questions
        the intuitive moralist is obliged to answer, that such a line cannot
        be drawn, that such a rule does not exist. The colours of our moral
        nature are rarely separated by the sharp lines of our vocabulary.
        They fade and blend into one another so imperceptibly, that it is
        impossible to mark a precise point of transition. The end of man is
        the full development of his being in that symmetry and proportion
        which nature has assigned it, and such a development implies that the
        supreme, the predominant motive of his life, should be moral. If in
        any society or individual this ascendency does not exist, that
        society or that individual is in a diseased and abnormal condition.
        But the superiority of the moral part of our nature, though
        unquestionable, is indefinite not infinite, and the prevailing
        standard is not at all times the same. The moralist can only lay down
        general <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name=
        "Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> principles. Individual
        feeling or the general sentiment of society must draw the
        application.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vagueness that
        on such questions confessedly hangs over the intuitive theory, has
        always been insisted upon by members of the opposite school, who 'in
        the greatest happiness principle' claim to possess a definite
        formulary, enabling them to draw boldly the frontier line between the
        lawful and the illicit, and to remove moral disputes from the domain
        of feeling to that of demonstration. But this claim, which forms the
        great attraction of the utilitarian school, is, if I mistake not, one
        of the grossest of impostures. We compare with accuracy and
        confidence the value of the most various material commodities, for we
        mean by this term, exchangeable value, and we have a common measure
        of exchange. But we seek in vain for such a measure enabling us to
        compare different kinds of utility or happiness. Thus, to take a very
        familiar example, the question may be proposed, whether excursion
        trains from a country district to a seaport town produce more good
        than evil, whether a man governed by moral principles should
        encourage or oppose them. They give innocent and healthy enjoyment to
        many thousands, they enlarge in some degree the range of their ideas,
        they can hardly be said to prevent any sin that would otherwise have
        been committed, they give rise to many cases of drunkenness, each of
        which, according to the theological doctrine we have reviewed, should
        be deemed a more dreadful calamity than the earthquake of Lisbon, or
        a visitation of the cholera, but which have not usually any lasting
        terrestrial effects; they also often produce a measure, and sometimes
        no small measure, of more serious vice, and it is probable that
        hundreds of women may trace their first fall to the excursion train.
        We have here a number of advantages and disadvantages, the first
        being intellectual and physical, and the second moral. Nearly all
        moralists would acknowledge that a few instances of immorality would
        not prevent the excursion train being, on the whole, a good thing.
        All would acknowledge that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg
        117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        very numerous instances would more than counterbalance its
        advantages. The intuitive moralist confesses that he is unable to
        draw a precise line, showing where the moral evils outweigh the
        physical benefits. In what possible respect the introduction of
        Benthamite formularies improves the matter, I am unable to
        understand. No utilitarian would reduce the question to one of simple
        majority, or would have the cynicism to balance the ruin of one woman
        by the day's enjoyment of another. The impossibility of drawing, in
        such cases, a distinct line of division, is no argument against the
        intuitive moralist, for that impossibility is shared to the full
        extent by his rival.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are, as we
        have seen, two kinds of interest with which utilitarian moralists are
        concerned—the private interest which they believe to be the ultimate
        motive, and the public interest which they believe to be the end, of
        all virtue. With reference to the first, the intuitive moralist
        denies that a selfish act can be a virtuous or meritorious one. If a
        man when about to commit a theft, became suddenly conscious of the
        presence of a policeman, and through fear of arrest and punishment
        were to abstain from the act he would otherwise have committed, this
        abstinence would not appear in the eyes of mankind to possess any
        moral value; and if he were determined partly by conscientious
        motives, and partly by fear, the presence of the latter element
        would, in proportion to its strength, detract from his merit. But
        although selfish considerations are distinctly opposed to virtuous
        ones, it would be a mistake to imagine they can never ultimately have
        a purely moral influence. In the first place, a well-ordered system
        of threats and punishments marks out the path of virtue with a
        distinctness of definition it could scarcely have otherwise attained.
        In the next place, it often happens that when the mind is swayed by a
        conflict of motives, the expectation of reward or punishment will so
        reinforce or support <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg
        118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        virtuous motives, as to secure their victory; and, as every triumph
        of these motives increases their strength and weakens the opposing
        principles, a step will thus have been made towards moral perfection,
        which will render more probable the future triumph of unassisted
        virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With reference to
        the interests of society, there are two distinct assertions to be
        made. The first is, that although the pursuit of the welfare of
        others is undoubtedly one form of virtue, it does not include all
        virtue, or, in other words, that there are forms of virtue which,
        even if beneficial to mankind, do not become virtuous on that
        account, but have an intrinsic excellence which is not proportioned
        to or dependent on their utility. The second is, that there may
        occasionally arise considerations of extreme and overwhelming utility
        that may justify a sacrifice of these virtues. This sacrifice may be
        made in various ways—as, when a man undertakes an enterprise which is
        in itself perfectly innocent, but which in addition to its great
        material advantages will, as he well knows, produce a certain measure
        of crime; or when, abstaining from a protest, he tacitly countenances
        beliefs which he considers untrue, because he regards them as
        transcendently useful; or again, when, for the benefit of others, and
        under circumstances of great urgency, he utters a direct falsehood,
        as, for example, when by such means alone he can save the life of an
        innocent man.<a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href=
        "#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> But the
        fact, that in these cases considerations of extreme utility are
        suffered to override <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
        119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        considerations of morality, is in no degree inconsistent with the
        facts, that the latter differ in kind from the former, that they are
        of a higher nature, and that they may supply adequate and legitimate
        motives of action not only distinct from, but even in opposition to
        utility. Gold and silver are different metals. Gold is more valuable
        than silver; yet a very small quantity of gold may be advantageously
        exchanged for a very large quantity of silver.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last class of
        objections to the theory of natural moral perceptions which it is
        necessary for me to notice, arises from a very mischievous
        equivocation in the word natural.<a id="noteref_132" name=
        "noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> The
        term natural man is sometimes regarded as synonymous with man in his
        primitive or barbarous condition, and sometimes as expressing all in
        a civilised man that is due to nature as distinguished from
        artificial habits or acquirements. This equivocation is especially
        dangerous, because it implies one of the most extravagant excesses to
        which the sensational philosophy could be pushed—the notion that the
        difference between a savage and a civilised man is simply a
        difference of acquisition, and not at all a difference of
        development. In accordance with this notion, those who deny original
        moral distinctions have ransacked the accounts of travellers for
        examples of savages who appeared destitute of moral sentiments, and
        have adduced them as conclusive evidence of their position. Now it
        is, I think, abundantly evident that these narratives are usually
        exceedingly untrustworthy.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133"
        href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> They
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120"
        id="Pg120" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> have been in most cases
        collected by uncritical and unphilosophical travellers, who knew
        little of the language and still less of the inner life of the people
        they described, whose means of information were acquired in simply
        traversing the country, who were more struck by moral paradox, than
        by unostentatious virtue, who were proverbially addicted to
        embellishing and exaggerating the singularities they witnessed, and
        who very rarely investigated their origin. It should not be forgotten
        that the French moralists of the last century, who insisted most
        strongly on this species of evidence, were also the dupes of one of
        the most curious delusions in the whole compass of literary history.
        Those unflinching sceptics who claimed to be the true disciples of
        the apostle who believed nothing that he had not touched, and whose
        relentless criticism played with withering effect on all the holiest
        feelings of our nature, and on all the tenets of traditional creeds,
        had discovered one happy land where the ideal had ceased to be a
        dream. They could point to one people whose pure and rational
        morality, purged from all the clouds of bigotry and enthusiasm, shone
        with an almost dazzling splendour above the ignorance and
        superstition of Europe. Voltaire forgot to gibe, and Helvétius
        kindled into enthusiasm, when China and the Chinese rose before their
        minds, and to this semi-barbarous nation they habitually attributed
        maxims of conduct that neither Roman nor Christian virtue had ever
        realised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But putting aside
        these considerations, and assuming the fidelity of the pictures of
        savage life upon which these writers rely, they fail to prove the
        point for which they are adduced. The moralists I am defending,
        assert that we possess a natural power of distinguishing between the
        higher and lower parts of our nature. But the eye of the mind, like
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg 121]</span><a name="Pg121"
        id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the eye of the body, may be
        closed. Moral and rational facilities may be alike dormant, and they
        will certainly be so if men are wholly immersed in the gratification
        of their senses. Man is like a plant, which requires a favourable
        soil for the full expansion of its natural or innate powers.<a id=
        "noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a> Yet
        those powers both rational and moral are there, and when quickened
        into action, each will discharge its appointed functions. If it could
        be proved that there are savages who are absolutely destitute of the
        progressive energy which distinguishes reason from instinct and of
        the moral aspiration which constitutes virtue, this would not prove
        that rational or moral faculties form no part of their nature. If it
        could be shown that there is a stage of barbarism in which man knows,
        feels and does nothing that might not be known, felt and done by an
        ape, this would not be sufficient to reduce him to the level of the
        brute. There would still be this broad distinction between them—the
        one possesses a capacity for development which the other does not
        possess. Under favourable circumstances the savage will become a
        reasoning, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg
        122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        progressive, and moral man: under no circumstances can a similar
        transformation be effected in the ape. It may be as difficult to
        detect the oakleaf in the acorn as in the stone; yet the acorn may be
        converted into an oak: the stone will always continue to be a
        stone.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The foregoing
        pages will, I trust, have exhibited with sufficient clearness the
        nature of the two great divisions of moral philosophy—the school
        which proceeds from the primitive truth that all men desire
        happiness, and endeavours out of this fact to evolve all ethical
        doctrines, and the school which traces our moral systems to an
        intuitive perception that certain parts of our nature are higher or
        better than others. It is obvious that this difference concerning the
        origin of our moral conceptions forms part of the very much wider
        metaphysical question, whether our ideas are derived exclusively from
        sensation or whether they spring in part from the mind itself. The
        latter theory in antiquity was chiefly represented by the Platonic
        doctrine of pre-existence, which rested on the conviction that the
        mind has the power of drawing from its own depths certain conceptions
        or ideas which cannot be explained by any post-natal experience, and
        must therefore, it was said, have been acquired in a previous
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page123">[pg 123]</span><a name="Pg123"
        id="Pg123" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> existence. In the seventeenth
        century it took the form of a doctrine of innate ideas. But though
        this theory in the form in which it was professed by Lord Herbert of
        Cherbury and assailed by Locke has almost disappeared, the doctrine
        that we possess certain faculties which by their own expansion, and
        not by the reception of notions from without, are not only capable
        of, but must necessarily attain, certain ideas, as the bud must
        necessarily expand into its own specific flower, still occupies a
        distinguished place in the world of speculation, and its probability
        has been greatly strengthened by recent observations of the range and
        potency of instinct in animals. From some passages in his Essay, it
        appears that Locke himself had a confused perception of this
        distinction,<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href=
        "#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a> which
        was by no means unknown to previous writers; and after the
        publication of the philosophy of Locke it was clearly exhibited by
        Shaftesbury and Leibnitz, and incidentally noticed by Berkeley long
        before Kant established his distinction between the form and the
        matter of our knowledge, between ideas which are received <span lang=
        "la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a priori</span></span> and ideas which are
        received <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">a posteriori</span></span>. The
        existence or non-existence of this source of ideas forms the basis of
        the opposition between the inductive philosophy of England and the
        French philosophy of the eighteenth century on the one hand, and the
        German and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page124">[pg
        124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Scotch philosophies, as well as the French eclecticism of the
        nineteenth century upon the other. The tendency of the first school
        is to restrict as far as possible the active powers of the human
        mind, and to aggrandise as far as possible the empire of external
        circumstances. The other school dwells especially on the instinctive
        side of our nature, and maintains the existence of certain intuitions
        of the reason, certain categories or original conceptions, which are
        presupposed in all our reasonings and cannot be resolved into
        sensations. The boast of the first school is that its searching
        analysis leaves no mental phenomenon unresolved, and its attraction
        is the extreme simplicity it can attain. The second school multiplies
        faculties or original principles, concentrates its attention mainly
        upon the nature of our understanding, and asserts very strongly the
        initiative force both of our will and of our intellect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We find this
        connection between a philosophy based upon the senses, and a morality
        founded upon utility from the earliest times. Aristotle was
        distinguished among the ancients for the emphasis with which he dwelt
        upon the utility of virtue, and it was from the writings of Aristotle
        that the schoolmen derived the famous formulary which has become the
        motto of the school of Locke. Locke himself devoted especial research
        to the refutation of the doctrine of a natural moral sense, which he
        endeavoured to overthrow by a catalogue of immoral practices that
        exist among savages, and the hesitation he occasionally exhibited in
        his moral doctrine corresponds not unfaithfully to the obscurity
        thrown over his metaphysics by the admission of reflection as a
        source of ideas. If his opponent Leibnitz made pleasure the object of
        moral action, it was only that refined pleasure which is produced by
        the contemplation of the happiness of others. When, however,
        Condillac and his followers, removing reflection from the position
        Locke had assigned it, reduced the philosophy of sensation to its
        simplest expression, and when the Scotch and German writers
        elaborated the principles of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the opposite school, the moral tendencies of
        both were indisputably manifested. Everywhere the philosophy of
        sensation was accompanied by the morals of interest, and the ideal
        philosophy, by an assertion of the existence of a moral faculty, and
        every influence that has affected the prevailing theory concerning
        the origin of our ideas, has exercised a corresponding influence upon
        the theories of ethics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The great movement
        of modern thought, of which Bacon was at once the highest
        representative and one of the chief agents, has been truly said to
        exhibit a striking resemblance, and at the same time a striking
        contrast, to the movement of ancient thought, which was effected
        chiefly by the genius of Socrates. In the name of utility, Socrates
        diverted the intellect of antiquity from the fantastic cosmogonies
        with which it had long been occupied, to the study of the moral
        nature of man. In the name of the same utility Bacon laboured to
        divert the modern intellect from the idle metaphysical speculations
        of the schoolmen to natural science, to which newly discovered
        instruments of research, his own sounder method, and a cluster of
        splendid intellects, soon gave an unprecedented impulse. To the
        indirect influence of this movement, perhaps, even more than to the
        direct teaching of Gassendi and Locke, may be ascribed the great
        ascendency of sensational philosophy among modern nations, and it is
        also connected with some of the most important differences between
        ancient and modern history. Among the ancients the human mind was
        chiefly directed to philosophical speculations, in which the law
        seems to be perpetual oscillation, while among the moderns it has
        rather tended towards physical science, and towards inventions, in
        which the law is perpetual progress. National power, and in most
        cases even national independence, implied among the ancients the
        constant energy of high intellectual or moral qualities. When the
        heroism or the genius of the people had relaxed, when an enervating
        philosophy or the lassitude that often accompanies civilisation
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126"
        id="Pg126" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> arrived, the whole edifice
        speedily tottered, the sceptre was transferred to another state, and
        the same history was elsewhere reproduced. A great nation bequeathed
        indeed to its successors works of transcendent beauty in art and
        literature, philosophies that could avail only when the mind had
        risen to their level, examples that might stimulate the heroism of an
        aspiring people, warnings that might sometimes arrest it on the path
        to ruin. But all these acted only through the mind. In modern times,
        on the other hand, if we put aside religious influences, the
        principal causes of the superiority of civilised men are to be found
        in inventions which when once discovered can never pass away, and the
        effects of which are in consequence in a great measure removed from
        the fluctuations of moral life. The causes which most disturbed or
        accelerated the normal progress of society in antiquity were the
        appearance of great men, in modern times they have been the
        appearance of great inventions. Printing has secured the intellectual
        achievements of the past, and furnished a sure guarantee of future
        progress. Gunpowder and military machinery have rendered the triumph
        of barbarians impossible. Steam has united nations in the closest
        bonds. Innumerable mechanical contrivances have given a decisive
        preponderance to that industrial element which has coloured all the
        developments of our civilisation. The leading characteristics of
        modern societies are in consequence marked out much more by the
        triumphs of inventive skill than by the sustained energy of moral
        causes.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now it will appear
        evident, I think, to those who reflect carefully upon their own
        minds, and upon the course of history, that these three things, the
        study of physical science, inventive skill, and industrial
        enterprise, are connected in such a manner, that when in any nation
        there is a long-sustained tendency towards one, the others will
        naturally follow. This connection is partly that of cause and effect,
        for success in either of these branches facilitates success in the
        others, a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg
        127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        knowledge of natural laws being the basis of many of the most
        important inventions, and being itself acquired by the aid of
        instruments of research, while industry is manifestly indebted to
        both. But besides this connection, there is a connection of
        congruity. The same cast or habit of thought developes itself in
        these three forms. They all represent the natural tendencies of what
        is commonly called the practical as opposed to the theoretical mind,
        of the inductive or experimental as opposed to the deductive or
        ideal, of the cautious and the plodding as opposed to the imaginative
        and the ambitious, of the mind that tends naturally to matter as
        opposed to that which dwells naturally on ideas. Among the ancients,
        the distaste for physical science, which the belief in the capricious
        divine government of all natural phenomena, and the distaste for
        industrial enterprise which slavery produced, conspired to favour the
        philosophical tendency, while among the moderns physical science and
        the habits of industrial life continually react upon one another.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can be no
        question that the intellectual tendencies of modern times are far
        superior to those of antiquity, both in respect to the material
        prosperity they effect, and to the uninterrupted progress they
        secure. Upon the other hand, it is, I think, equally unquestionable
        that this superiority is purchased by the sacrifice of something of
        dignity and elevation of character. It is when the cultivation of
        mental and moral qualities is deemed the primary object, when the
        mind and its interests are most removed from the things of sense,
        that great characters are most frequent, and the standard of heroism
        is most high. In this, as in other cases, the law of congruity is
        supreme. The mind that is concentrated most on the properties of
        matter, is predisposed to derive all ideas from the senses, while
        that which dwells naturally upon its own operations inclines to an
        ideal philosophy, and the prevailing system of morals depends largely
        upon the distinction.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        we may observe that the practical <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> consequences, so far as ethics are
        concerned,<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href=
        "#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> of the
        opposition between the two great schools of morals, are less than
        might be inferred from the intellectual chasm that separates them.
        Moralists grow up in the atmosphere of society, and experience all
        the common feelings of other men. Whatever theory of the genesis of
        morals they may form, they commonly recognise as right the broad
        moral principles of the world, and they endeavour—though I have
        attempted to show not always successfully—to prove that these
        principles may be accounted for and justified by their system. The
        great practical difference between the schools lies, not in the
        difference of the virtues they inculcate, but in the different
        degrees of prominence they assign to each, in the different casts of
        mind they represent and promote. As Adam Smith observed, a system
        like that of the Stoics, which makes self-control the ideal of
        excellence, is especially favourable to the heroic qualities, a
        system like that of Hutcheson, which resolves virtue into
        benevolence, to the amiable qualities, and utilitarian systems to the
        industrial virtues. A society in which any one of these three forms
        of moral excellence is especially prominent, has a natural tendency
        towards the corresponding theory of ethics; but, on the other hand,
        this theory, when formed, reacts upon and strengthens the moral
        tendency that elicited it. The Epicureans and the Stoics can each
        claim a great historical fact in their favour. When every other Greek
        school modified or abandoned the teaching of its founder, the
        disciples of Epicurus at Athens preserved their hereditary faith
        unsullied and unchanged.<a id="noteref_138" name="noteref_138" href=
        "#note_138"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">138</span></span></a> On the
        other hand, in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
        129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Roman empire, almost every great character, almost every effort in
        the cause of liberty, emanated from the ranks of Stoicism, while
        Epicureanism was continually identified with corruption and with
        tyranny. The intuitive school, not having a clear and simple external
        standard, has often proved somewhat liable to assimilate with
        superstition and mysticism, to become fantastic, unreasoning, and
        unpractical, while the prominence accorded to interest, and the
        constant intervention of calculation in utilitarian systems, have a
        tendency to depress the ideal, and give a sordid and unheroic ply to
        the character. The first, dwelling on the moral initiative, elevates
        the tone and standard of life. The second, revealing the influence of
        surrounding circumstances upon character, leads to the most important
        practical reforms.<a id="noteref_139" name="noteref_139" href=
        "#note_139"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">139</span></span></a> Each
        school has thus proved in some sense at once the corrective and the
        complement of the other. Each when pushed to its extreme results,
        produces evils which lead to the reappearance of its rival.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having now
        considered at some length the nature and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> tendencies of the theories according to which
        men test and classify their moral feelings, we may pass to an
        examination of the process according to which these feelings are
        developed, or, in other words, of the causes that lead societies to
        elevate their moral standard and determine their preference of some
        particular kinds of virtue. The observations I have to offer on this
        subject will be of a somewhat miscellaneous character, but they will
        all, I trust, tend to show the nature of the changes that constitute
        moral history, and to furnish us with some general principles which
        may be applied in detail in the succeeding chapters.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is sufficiently
        evident, that, in proportion to the high organisation of society, the
        amiable and the social virtues will be cultivated at the expense of
        the heroic and the ascetic. A courageous endurance of suffering is
        probably the first form of human virtue, the one conspicuous instance
        in savage life of a course of conduct opposed to natural impulses,
        and pursued through a belief that it is higher or nobler than the
        opposite. In a disturbed, disorganised, and warlike society, acts of
        great courage and great endurance are very frequent, and determine to
        a very large extent the course of events; but in proportion to the
        organisation of communities the occasions for their display, and
        their influence when displayed, are alike restricted. Besides this
        the tastes and habits of civilisation, the innumerable inventions
        designed to promote comfort and diminish pain, set the current of
        society in a direction altogether different from heroism, and
        somewhat emasculate, though they refine and soften, the character.
        Asceticism again—including under this term, not merely the monastic
        system, but also all efforts to withdraw from the world in order to
        cultivate a high degree of sanctity—belongs naturally to a society
        which is somewhat rude, and in which isolation is frequent and easy.
        When men become united in very close bonds of co-operation, when
        industrial enterprise becomes very ardent, and the prevailing impulse
        is strongly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg
        131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        towards material wealth and luxurious enjoyments, virtue is regarded
        chiefly or solely in the light of the interests of society, and this
        tendency is still further strengthened by the educational influence
        of legislation, which imprints moral distinctions very deeply on the
        mind, but at the same time accustoms men to measure them solely by an
        external and utilitarian standard.<a id="noteref_140" name=
        "noteref_140" href="#note_140"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">140</span></span></a> The
        first table of the law gives way to the second. Good is not loved for
        itself, but as the means to an end. All that virtue which is required
        to form upright and benevolent men is in the highest degree useful to
        society, but the qualities which constitute a saintly or spiritual
        character as distinguished from one that is simply moral and amiable,
        have not the same direct, uniform and manifest tendency to the
        promotion of happiness, and they are accordingly little valued.<a id=
        "noteref_141" name="noteref_141" href="#note_141"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        savage life the animal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg
        132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        nature being supreme, these higher qualities are unknown. In a very
        elaborate material civilisation the prevailing atmosphere is not
        favourable either to their production or their appreciation. Their
        place has usually been in an intermediate stage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the other hand,
        there are certain virtues that are the natural product of a
        cultivated society. Independently of all local and special
        circumstances, the transition of men from a barbarous or
        semi-civilised to a highly organised state necessarily brings with it
        the destruction or abridgment of the legitimate sphere of revenge, by
        transferring the office of punishment from the wronged person to a
        passionless tribunal appointed by society;<a id="noteref_142" name=
        "noteref_142" href="#note_142"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">142</span></span></a> a
        growing substitution of pacific for warlike occupations, the
        introduction of refined and intellectual tastes which gradually
        displace amusements that derive their zest from their barbarity, the
        rapid multiplication of ties of connection between all classes and
        nations, and also the strengthening of the imagination by
        intellectual culture. This last faculty, considered as the power of
        realisation, forms the chief tie between our moral and intellectual
        natures. In order to pity suffering we must realise it, and the
        intensity of our compassion is usually proportioned to the vividness
        of our realisation.<a id="noteref_143" name="noteref_143" href=
        "#note_143"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">143</span></span></a> The
        most frightful catastrophe in South America, an earthquake, a
        shipwreck, or a battle, will elicit less compassion than the death of
        a single individual who has been brought prominently before our eyes.
        To this cause must be chiefly ascribed the extraordinary measure of
        compassion usually bestowed upon a conspicuous <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> condemned criminal, the affection and
        enthusiasm that centre upon sovereigns, and many of the glaring
        inconsistencies of our historical judgments. The recollection of some
        isolated act of magnanimity displayed by Alexander or Cæsar moves us
        more than the thought of the 30,000 Thebans whom the Macedonian sold
        as slaves, of the 2,000 prisoners he crucified at Tyre, of the
        1,100,000 men on whose corpses the Roman rose to fame. Wrapt in the
        pale winding-sheet of general terms the greatest tragedies of history
        evoke no vivid images in our minds, and it is only by a great effort
        of genius that an historian can galvanise them into life. The
        irritation displayed by the captive of St. Helena in his bickerings
        with his gaoler affects most men more than the thought of the
        nameless thousands whom his insatiable egotism had hurried to the
        grave. Such is the frailty of our nature that we are more moved by
        the tears of some captive princess, by some trifling biographical
        incident that has floated down the stream of history, than by the
        sorrows of all the countless multitudes who perished beneath the
        sword of a Tamerlane, a Bajazet, or a Zenghis Khan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If our benevolent
        feelings are thus the slaves of our imaginations, if an act of
        realisation is a necessary antecedent and condition of compassion, it
        is obvious that any influence that augments the range and power of
        this realising faculty is favourable to the amiable virtues, and it
        is equally evident that education has in the highest degree this
        effect. To an uneducated man all classes, nations, modes of thought
        and existence foreign to his own are unrealised, while every increase
        of knowledge brings with it an increase of insight, and therefore of
        sympathy. But the addition to his knowledge is the smallest part of
        this change. The realising faculty is itself intensified. Every book
        he reads, every intellectual exercise in which he engages, accustoms
        him to rise above the objects immediately present to his senses, to
        extend his realisations into new spheres, and reproduce in his
        imagination <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
        134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        thoughts, feelings, and characters of others, with a vividness
        inconceivable to the savage. Hence, in a great degree, the tact with
        which a refined mind learns to discriminate and adapt itself to the
        most delicate shades of feeling, and hence too the sensitive humanity
        with which, in proportion to their civilisation, men realise and
        recoil from cruelty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have here,
        however, an important distinction to draw. Under the name of cruelty
        are comprised two kinds of vice, altogether different in their causes
        and in most of their consequences. There is the cruelty which springs
        from callousness and brutality, and there is the cruelty of
        vindictiveness. The first belongs chiefly to hard, dull, and somewhat
        lethargic characters, it appears most frequently in strong and
        conquering nations and in temperate climates, and it is due in a very
        great degree to defective realisation. The second is rather a
        feminine attribute, it is usually displayed in oppressed and
        suffering communities, in passionate natures, and in hot climates.
        Great vindictiveness is often united with great tenderness, and great
        callousness with great magnanimity, but a vindictive nature is rarely
        magnanimous, and a brutal nature is still more rarely tender. The
        ancient Romans exhibited a remarkable combination of great
        callousness and great magnanimity, while by a curious contrast the
        modern Italian character verges manifestly towards the opposite
        combination. Both forms of cruelty are, if I mistake not, diminished
        with advancing civilisation, but by different causes and in different
        degrees. Callous cruelty disappears before the sensitiveness of a
        cultivated imagination. Vindictive cruelty is diminished by the
        substitution of a penal system for private revenge.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same
        intellectual culture that facilitates the realisation of suffering,
        and therefore produces compassion, facilitates also the realisation
        of character and opinions, and therefore produces charity. The great
        majority of uncharitable judgments in the world may be traced to a
        deficiency of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
        135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        imagination. The chief cause of sectarian animosity, is the
        incapacity of most men to conceive hostile systems in the light in
        which they appear to their adherents, and to enter into the
        enthusiasm they inspire. The acquisition of this power of
        intellectual sympathy is a common accompaniment of a large and
        cultivated mind, and wherever it exists, it assuages the rancour of
        controversy. The severity of our judgment of criminals is also often
        excessive, because the imagination finds it more easy to realise an
        action than a state of mind. Any one can conceive a fit of
        drunkenness or a deed of violence, but few persons who are by nature
        very sober or very calm can conceive the natural disposition that
        predisposes to it. A good man brought up among all the associations
        of virtue reads of some horrible crime, his imagination exhausts
        itself in depicting its circumstances, and he then estimates the
        guilt of the criminal, by asking himself, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“How guilty should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">I</span></em> be, were I to perpetrate such an
        act?”</span> To realise with any adequacy the force of a passion we
        have never experienced, to conceive a type of character radically
        different from our own, above all, to form any just appreciation of
        the lawlessness and obtuseness of moral temperament, inevitably
        generated by a vicious education, requires a power of imagination
        which is among the rarest of human endowments. Even in judging our
        own conduct, this feebleness of imagination is sometimes shown, and
        an old man recalling the foolish actions, but having lost the power
        of realising the feelings, of his youth, may be very unjust to his
        own past. That which makes it so difficult for a man of strong
        vicious passions to unbosom himself to a naturally virtuous man, is
        not so much the virtue as the ignorance of the latter. It is the
        conviction that he cannot possibly understand the force of a passion
        he has never felt. That which alone renders tolerable to the mind the
        thought of judgment by an all-pure Being, is the union of the
        attribute of omniscience with that of purity, for perfect
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136"
        id="Pg136" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> knowledge implies a perfect
        power of realisation. The further our analysis extends, and the more
        our realising faculties are cultivated, the more sensible we become
        of the influence of circumstances both upon character and upon
        opinions, and of the exaggerations of our first estimates of moral
        inequalities. Strong antipathies are thus gradually softened down.
        Men gain much in charity, but they lose something in zeal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may push, I
        think, this vein of thought one step farther. Our imagination, which
        governs our affections, has in its earlier and feebler stages little
        power of grasping ideas, except in a personified and concrete form,
        and the power of rising to abstractions is one of the best measures
        of intellectual progress. The beginning of writing is the
        hieroglyphic or symbolical picture; the beginning of worship is
        fetishism or idolatry; the beginning of eloquence is pictorial,
        sensuous, and metaphorical; the beginning of philosophy is the myth.
        The imagination in its first stages concentrates itself on
        individuals; gradually by an effort of abstraction it rises to an
        institution or well-defined organisation; it is only at a very
        advanced stage that it can grasp a moral and intellectual principle.
        Loyalty, patriotism, and attachment to a cosmopolitan cause are
        therefore three forms of moral enthusiasm respectively appropriate to
        three successive stages of mental progress, and they have, I think, a
        certain analogy to idolatrous worship, church feeling, and moral
        culture, which are the central ideas of three stages of religious
        history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader will
        readily understand that generalisations of this kind can pretend to
        nothing more than an approximate truth. Our knowledge of the laws of
        moral progress is like that of the laws of climate. We lay down
        general rules about the temperature to be expected as we approach or
        recede from the equator, and experience shows that they are
        substantially correct; but yet an elevated plain, or a chain of
        mountains, or the neighbourhood of the sea, will often in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137"
        id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> some degree derange our
        calculations. So, too, in the history of moral changes, innumerable
        special agencies, such as religious or political institutions,
        geographical conditions, traditions, antipathies, and affinities,
        exercise a certain retarding, accelerating, or deflecting influence,
        and somewhat modify the normal progress. The proposition for which I
        am contending is simply that there is such a thing as a natural
        history of morals, a defined and regular order, in which our moral
        feelings are unfolded; or, in other words, that there are certain
        groups of virtues which spring spontaneously out of the circumstances
        and mental conditions of an uncivilised people, and that there are
        others which are the normal and appropriate products of civilisation.
        The virtues of uncivilised men are recognised as virtues by civilised
        men, but they are neither exhibited in the same perfection, nor given
        the same position in the scale of duties. Of these moral changes none
        are more obvious than the gradual decadence of heroism both active
        and passive, the increase of compassion and of charity, and the
        transition from the enthusiasm of loyalty to those of patriotism and
        liberty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another form of
        virtue which usually increases with civilisation is veracity, a term
        which must be regarded as including something more than the simple
        avoidance of direct falsehood. In the ordinary intercourse of life it
        is readily understood that a man is offending against truth, not only
        when he utters a deliberate falsehood, but also when in his statement
        of a case he suppresses or endeavours to conceal essential facts, or
        makes positive assertions without having conscientiously verified
        their grounds. The earliest form in which the duty of veracity is
        enforced is probably the observance of vows, which occupy a position
        of much prominence in youthful religions. With the subsequent
        progress of civilisation, we find the successive inculcation of three
        forms of veracity, which may be termed respectively industrial,
        political, and philosophical. By the first I understand that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name="Pg138"
        id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> accuracy of statement or
        fidelity to engagements which is commonly meant when we speak of a
        truthful man. Though in some cases sustained by the strong sense of
        honour which accompanies a military spirit, this form of veracity is
        usually the special virtue of an industrial nation, for although
        industrial enterprise affords great temptations to deception, mutual
        confidence, and therefore strict truthfulness, are in these
        occupations so transcendently important that they acquire in the
        minds of men a value they had never before possessed. Veracity
        becomes the first virtue in the moral type, and no character is
        regarded with any kind of approbation in which it is wanting. It is
        made more than any other the test distinguishing a good from a bad
        man. We accordingly find that even where the impositions of trade are
        very numerous, the supreme excellence of veracity is cordially
        admitted in theory, and it is one of the first virtues that every man
        aspiring to moral excellence endeavours to cultivate. This
        constitutes probably the chief moral superiority of nations pervaded
        by a strong industrial spirit over nations like the Italians, the
        Spaniards, or the Irish, among whom that spirit is wanting. The usual
        characteristic of the latter nations is a certain laxity or
        instability of character, a proneness to exaggeration, a want of
        truthfulness in little things, an infidelity to engagements from
        which an Englishman, educated in the habits of industrial life,
        readily infers a complete absence of moral principle. But a larger
        philosophy and a deeper experience dispel his error. He finds that
        where the industrial spirit has not penetrated, truthfulness rarely
        occupies in the popular mind the same prominent position in the
        catalogue of virtues. It is not reckoned among the fundamentals of
        morality, and it is possible and even common to find in those
        nations—what would be scarcely possible in an industrial society—men
        who are habitually dishonest and untruthful in small things, and
        whose lives are nevertheless influenced by a deep religious feeling,
        and adorned by the consistent practice <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page139">[pg 139]</span><a name="Pg139" id="Pg139" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of some of the most difficult and most painful
        virtues. Trust in Providence, content and resignation in extreme
        poverty and suffering, the most genuine amiability and the most
        sincere readiness to assist their brethren, an adherence to their
        religious opinions which no persecutions and no bribes can shake, a
        capacity for heroic, transcendent, and prolonged self-sacrifice, may
        be found in some nations in men who are habitual liars and habitual
        cheats.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The promotion of
        industrial veracity is probably the single form in which the growth
        of manufactures exercises a favourable influence upon morals. It is
        possible, however, for this virtue to exist in great perfection
        without any corresponding growth of political veracity, or in other
        words, of that spirit of impartiality which in matters of controversy
        desires that all opinions, arguments, and facts should be fully and
        fairly stated. This habit of what is commonly termed <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“fair play”</span> is especially the characteristic of
        free communities, and it is pre-eminently fostered by political life.
        The practice of debate creates a sense of the injustice of
        suppressing one side of a case, which gradually extends through all
        forms of intellectual life, and becomes an essential element in the
        national character. But beyond all this there is a still higher form
        of intellectual virtue. By enlarged intellectual culture, especially
        by philosophic studies, men come at last to pursue truth for its own
        sake, to esteem it a duty to emancipate themselves from party spirit,
        prejudices, and passion, and through love of truth to cultivate a
        judicial spirit in controversy. They aspire to the intellect not of a
        sectarian but of a philosopher, to the intellect not of a partisan
        but of a statesman.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these three
        forms of a truthful spirit the two last may be said to belong
        exclusively to a highly civilised society. The last especially can
        hardly be attained by any but a cultivated mind, and is one of the
        latest flowers of virtue that bloom in the human heart. The growth,
        however, both of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg
        140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        political and philosophical veracity has been unnaturally retarded by
        the opposition of theologians, who made it during many centuries a
        main object of their policy to suppress all writings that were
        opposed to their views, and who, when this power had escaped their
        grasp, proceeded to discourage in every way impartiality of mind and
        judgment, and to associate it with the notion of sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To the
        observations I have already made concerning the moral effects of
        industrial life, I shall at present add but two. The first is that an
        industrial spirit creates two wholly different types of character—a
        thrifty character and a speculating character. Both types grow out of
        a strong sense of the value and a strong desire for the attainment of
        material comforts, but they are profoundly different both in their
        virtues and their vices. The chief characteristic of the one type is
        caution, that of the other enterprise. Thriftiness is one of the best
        regulators of life. It produces order, sobriety, moderation,
        self-restraint, patient industry, and all that cast of virtues which
        is designated by the term respectability; but it has also a tendency
        to form contracted and ungenerous natures, incapable of enthusiasm or
        lively sympathy. The speculating character, on the other hand, is
        restless, fiery, and uncertain, very liable to fall into great and
        conspicuous vices, impatient of routine, but by no means unfavourable
        to strong feelings, to great generosity or resolution. Which of these
        two forms the industrial spirit assumes depends upon local
        circumstances. Thriftiness flourishes chiefly among men placed
        outside the great stream of commerce, and in positions where wealth
        is only to be acquired by slow and steady industry, while the
        speculating character is most common in the great centres of
        enterprise and of wealth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        it may be remarked that industrial habits bring forethought into a
        new position in the moral type. In early stages of theological
        belief, men regarding <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg
        141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        every incident that happens to them as the result of a special divine
        decree, sometimes esteem it a test of faith and a form of duty to
        take no precautions for the future, but to leave questions of food
        and clothing to Providential interposition. On the other hand, in an
        industrial civilisation, prudent forethought is regarded not simply
        as lawful, but as a duty, and a duty of the very highest order. A
        good man of the industrial type deems it a duty not to marry till he
        has ensured the maintenance of a possible family; if he possesses
        children, he regulates his expenses not simply by the relation of his
        income to his immediate wants, but with a constant view to the
        education of his sons, to the portioning of his daughters, to the
        future necessities and careers of each member of his family. Constant
        forethought is the guiding principle of his whole life. No single
        circumstance is regarded as a better test of the civilisation of a
        people than the extent to which it is diffused among them. The old
        doctrine virtually disappears, and is interpreted to mean nothing
        more than that we should accept with resignation what no efforts and
        no forethought could avert.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This change is but
        one of several influences which, as civilisation advances, diminish
        the spirit of reverence among mankind. Reverence is one of those
        feelings which, in utilitarian systems, would occupy at best a very
        ambiguous position; for it is extremely questionable whether the
        great evils that have grown out of it in the form of religious
        superstition and political servitude have not made it a source of
        more unhappiness than happiness. Yet, however doubtful may be its
        position if estimated by its bearing on happiness and on progress,
        there are few persons who are not conscious that no character can
        attain a supreme degree of excellence in which a reverential spirit
        is wanting. Of all the forms of moral goodness it is that to which
        the epithet beautiful may be most emphatically applied. Yet the
        habits of advancing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page142">[pg
        142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        civilisation are, if I mistake not, on the whole inimical to its
        growth. For reverence grows out of a sense of constant dependence. It
        is fostered by that condition of religions thought in which men
        believe that each incident that befalls them is directly and
        specially ordained, and when every event is therefore fraught with a
        moral import. It is fostered by that condition of scientific
        knowledge in which every portentous natural phenomenon is supposed to
        be the result of a direct divine interposition, and awakens in
        consequence emotions of humility and awe. It is fostered in that
        stage of political life when loyalty or reverence for the sovereign
        is the dominating passion, when an aristocracy, branching forth from
        the throne, spreads habits of deference and subordination through
        every village, when a revolutionary, a democratic, and a sceptical
        spirit are alike unknown. Every great change, either of belief or of
        circumstances, brings with it a change of emotions. The
        self-assertion of liberty, the levelling of democracy, the
        dissecting-knife of criticism, the economical revolutions that reduce
        the relations of classes to simple contracts, the agglomeration of
        population, and the facilities of locomotion that sever so many
        ancient ties, are all incompatible with the type of virtue which
        existed before the power of tradition was broken, and when the
        chastity of faith was yet unstained. Benevolence, uprightness,
        enterprise, intellectual honesty, a love of freedom, and a hatred of
        superstition are growing around us, but we look in vain for that most
        beautiful character of the past, so distrustful of self, and so
        trustful of others, so simple, so modest, and so devout, which even
        when, Ixion-like, it bestowed its affections upon a cloud, made its
        very illusions the source of some of the purest virtues of our
        nature. In a few minds, the contemplation of the sublime order of
        nature produces a reverential feeling, but to the great majority of
        mankind it is an incontestable though mournful fact, that the
        discovery of controlling and unchanging law deprives phenomena of
        their moral significance, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
        143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        nearly all the social and political spheres in which reverence was
        fostered have passed away. Its most beautiful displays are not in
        nations like the Americans or the modern French, who have thrown
        themselves most fully into the tendencies of the age, but rather in
        secluded regions like Styria or the Tyrol. Its artistic expression is
        found in no work of modern genius, but in the mediæval cathedral,
        which, mellowed but not impaired by time, still gazes on us in its
        deathless beauty through the centuries of the past. A superstitious
        age, like every other phase of human history, has its distinctive
        virtues, which must necessarily decline before a new stage of
        progress can be attained.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The virtues and
        vices growing out of the relation between the sexes are difficult to
        treat in general terms, both on account of the obvious delicacy of
        the subject, and also because their natural history is extremely
        obscured by special causes. In the moral evolutions we have as yet
        examined, the normal influences are most powerful, and the importance
        of deranging and modifying circumstances is altogether subsidiary.
        The expansion of the amiable virtues, the decline of heroism and
        loyalty, and the growth of industrial habits spring out of changes
        which necessarily take place under almost all forms of
        civilisation,<a id="noteref_144" name="noteref_144" href=
        "#note_144"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">144</span></span></a> and the
        broad features of the movement are therefore in almost all nations
        substantially the same. But in the history of sensuality, special
        causes, such as slavery, religious doctrines, or laws affecting
        marriage, have been the most powerful agents. The immense changes
        effected in this field by the Christian religion I shall hereafter
        examine. In the present chapter I shall content myself with two or
        three very general remarks relating to the nature of the vice, and to
        the effect of different stages of civilisation upon its
        progress.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page144">[pg
        144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are, I
        conceive, few greater fallacies than are involved in the method so
        popular among modern writers of judging the immorality of a nation by
        its statistics of illegitimate births. Independently of the obvious
        defect of this method in excluding simple prostitution from our
        comparison, it altogether neglects the fact that a large number of
        illegitimate births arise from causes totally different from the
        great violence of the passions. Such, for example, is the notion
        prevailing in many country districts of England, that the marriage
        ceremony has a retrospective virtue, cancelling previous immorality;
        and such too is the custom so general among some classes on the
        Continent of forming permanent connections without the sanction
        either of a legal or a religious ceremony. However deeply such facts
        may be reprehended and deplored, it would be obviously absurd to
        infer from them that the nations in which they are most prominent are
        most conspicuous for the uncontrolled violence of their sensual
        passions. In Sweden, which long ranked among the lowest in the moral
        scale, if measured by the number of illegitimate births, the chief
        cause appears to have been the difficulties with which legislators
        surrounded marriage.<a id="noteref_145" name="noteref_145" href=
        "#note_145"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">145</span></span></a> Even in
        displays of actual and violent passion, there are distinctions to be
        drawn which statistics are wholly unable to reach. The coarse,
        cynical, and ostentatious sensuality which forms the most repulsive
        feature of the French character, the dreamy, languid, and æsthetical
        sensuality of the Spaniard or the Italian, the furtive and retiring
        sensuality of some northern nations, though all forms of the same
        vice, are widely different feelings, and exercise widely different
        effects upon the prevailing disposition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to the
        very important influence upon public morals which climate, I think,
        undoubtedly exercises in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg
        145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        stimulating or allaying the passions, it has a powerful indirect
        action upon the position, character, and tastes of women, by
        determining the prevalence of indoor or out-of-door life, and also
        the classes among whom the gift of beauty is diffused. In northern
        countries the prevailing cast of beauty depends rather on colour than
        on form. It consists chiefly of a freshness and delicacy of
        complexion which severe labour and constant exposure necessarily
        destroy, and which is therefore rarely found in the highest
        perfection among the very poor. But the southern type is essentially
        democratic. The fierce rays of the sun only mellow and mature its
        charms. Its most perfect examples may be found in the hovel as in the
        palace, and the effects of this diffusion of beauty may be traced
        both in the manners and the morals of the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
        that the observance of this form of virtue is naturally most strict
        in a rude and semi-civilised but not barbarous people, and that a
        very refined civilisation is not often favourable to its growth.
        Sensuality is the vice of young men and of old nations. A languid
        epicureanism is the normal condition of nations which have attained a
        high intellectual or social civilisation, but which, through
        political causes, have no adequate sphere for the exertion of their
        energies. The temptation arising from the great wealth of some, and
        from the feverish longing for luxury and exciting pleasures in
        others, which exists in all large towns, has been peculiarly fatal to
        female virtue, and the whole tendency of the public amusements of
        civilisation is in the same direction. The rude combats which form
        the chief enjoyments of barbarians produce cruelty. The dramatic and
        artistic tastes and the social habits of refined men produce
        sensuality. Education raises many poor women to a stage of refinement
        that makes them suitable companions for men of a higher rank, and not
        suitable for those of their own. Industrial pursuits have, indeed, a
        favourable influence in promoting habits of self-restraint, and
        especially in checking the licence <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of military life; but on the other hand, they
        greatly increase temptation by encouraging postponement of marriage,
        and in communities, even more than in individuals, moral inequalities
        are much more due to differences of temptation than to differences of
        self-restraint. In large bodies of men a considerable increase of
        temptation always brings with it an increase, though not necessarily
        a proportionate increase, of vice. Among the checks on excessive
        multiplication, the historical influence of voluntary continence has
        been, it must be feared, very small. Physical and moral evils have
        alone been decisive, and as these form the two opposite weights, we
        unhappily very frequently find that the diminution of the one has
        been followed by the increase of the other. The nearly universal
        custom of early marriages among the Irish peasantry has alone
        rendered possible that high standard of female chastity, that intense
        and jealous sensitiveness respecting female honour, for which, among
        many failings and some vices, the Irish poor have long been
        pre-eminent in Europe; but these very marriages are the most
        conspicuous proofs of the national improvidence, and one of the most
        fatal obstacles to industrial prosperity. Had the Irish peasants been
        less chaste, they would have been more prosperous. Had that fearful
        famine, which in the present century desolated the land, fallen upon
        a people who thought more of accumulating subsistence than of
        avoiding sin, multitudes might now be living who perished by literal
        starvation on the dreary hills of Limerick or Skibbereen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The example of
        Ireland furnishes us, however, with a remarkable instance of the
        manner in which the influence of a moral feeling may act beyond the
        circumstances that gave it birth. There is no fact in Irish history
        more singular than the complete, and, I believe, unparalleled absence
        among the Irish priesthood of those moral scandals which in every
        continental country occasionally prove the danger of vows of
        celibacy. The unsuspected purity of the Irish priests in this
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147"
        id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> respect is the more
        remarkable, because, the government of the country being Protestant,
        there is no special inquisitorial legislation to ensure it, because
        of the almost unbounded influence of the clergy over their
        parishioners, and also because if any just cause of suspicion
        existed, in the fierce sectarianism of Irish public opinion, it would
        assuredly be magnified. Considerations of climate are quite
        inadequate to explain this fact; but the chief cause is, I think,
        sufficiently obvious. The habit of marrying at the first development
        of the passions has produced among the Irish peasantry, from whom the
        priests for the most part spring, an extremely strong feeling of the
        iniquity of irregular sexual indulgence, which retains its power even
        over those who are bound to perpetual celibacy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will appear
        evident from the foregoing considerations that, while the essential
        nature of virtue and vice is unaltered, there is a perpetual, and in
        some branches an orderly and necessary change, as society advances,
        both in the proportionate value attached to different virtues in
        theory, and in the perfection in which they are realised in practice.
        It will appear too that, while there may be in societies such a thing
        as moral improvement, there is rarely or never, on a large scale,
        such a thing as unmixed improvement. We may gain more than we lose,
        but we always lose something. There are virtues which are continually
        dying away with advancing civilisation, and even the lowest stage
        possesses its distinctive excellence. There is no spectacle more
        piteous or more horrible to a good man than that of an oppressed
        nationality writhing in anguish beneath a tyrant's yoke; but there is
        no condition in which passionate, unquestioning self-sacrifice and
        heroic courage, and the true sentiment of fraternity are more grandly
        elicited, and it is probable that the triumph of liberty will in
        these forms not only lessen the moral performances, but even weaken
        the moral capacities of mankind. War is, no doubt, a fearful evil,
        but it is the seed-plot of magnanimous virtues, which in a pacific
        age must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg
        148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        wither and decay. Even the gambling-table fosters among its more
        skilful votaries a kind of moral nerve, a capacity for bearing losses
        with calmness, and controlling the force of the desires, which is
        scarcely exhibited in equal perfection in any other sphere.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is still so
        great a diversity of civilisation in existing nations that traversing
        tracts of space is almost like traversing tracts of time, for it
        brings us in contact with living representatives of nearly every
        phase of past civilisation. But these differences are rapidly
        disappearing before the unparalleled diffusion and simplification of
        knowledge, the still more amazing progress in means of locomotion,
        and the political and military causes that are manifestly converting
        Europe into a federation of vast centralised and democratic States.
        Even to those who believe that the leading changes are on the whole
        beneficial, there is much that is melancholy in this revolution.
        Those small States which will soon have disappeared from the map of
        Europe, besides their vast superiority to most great empires in
        financial prosperity, in the material well-being of the inhabitants,
        and in many cases in political liberty, pacific tastes, and
        intellectual progress, form one of the chief refuges of that spirit
        of content, repose, and retrospective reverence which is
        pre-eminently wanting in modern civilisation, and their security is
        in every age one of the least equivocal measures of international
        morality. The monastic system, however pernicious when enlarged to
        excess, has undoubtedly contributed to the happiness of the world, by
        supplying an asylum especially suited to a certain type of character;
        and that vindictive and short-sighted revolution which is extirpating
        it from Europe is destroying one of the best correctives of the
        excessive industrialism of our age. It is for the advantage of a
        nation that it should attain the most advanced existing type of
        progress, but it is extremely questionable whether it is for the
        advantage of the community at large that all nations <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> should attain the same type, even when it
        is the most advanced. The influence of very various circumstances is
        absolutely necessary to perfect moral development. Hence, one of the
        great political advantages of class representation, which brings
        within the range of politics a far greater variety both of capacities
        and moral qualities than can be exhibited when one class has an
        exclusive or overwhelmingly preponderating influence, and also of
        heterogeneous empires, in which different degrees of civilisation
        produce different kinds of excellence which react upon and complete
        one another. In the rude work of India and Australia a type of
        character is formed which England could ill afford to lose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remarks I have
        now made will be sufficient, I hope, to throw some light upon those
        great questions concerning the relations of intellectual and moral
        progress which have of late years attracted so large an amount of
        attention. It has been contended that the historian of human progress
        should concentrate his attention exclusively on the intellectual
        elements; for there is no such thing as moral history, morals being
        essentially stationary, and the rudest barbarians being in this
        respect as far advanced as ourselves. In opposition to this view, I
        have maintained that while what may be termed the primal elements of
        morals are unaltered, there is a perpetual change in the standard
        which is exacted, and also in the relative value attached to
        particular virtues, and that these changes constitute one of the most
        important branches of general history. It has been contended by other
        writers that, although such changes do take place, and although they
        play an extremely great part in the world, they must be looked upon
        as the result of intellectual causes, changes in knowledge producing
        changes in morals. In this view, as we have seen, there is some
        truth, but it can only, I think, be accepted with great
        qualification. It is one of the plainest of facts that neither the
        individuals nor the ages most distinguished for intellectual
        achievements have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg
        150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        most distinguished for moral excellence, and that a high intellectual
        and material civilisation has often coexisted with much depravity. In
        some respects the conditions of intellectual growth are not
        favourable to moral growth. The agglomeration of men in great
        cities—which are always the centres of progress and enlightenment—is
        one of the most important causes of material and intellectual
        advance: but great towns are the peculiar seed-plots of vice, and it
        is extremely questionable whether they produce any special and
        equivalent efflorescence of virtue, for even the social virtues are
        probably more cultivated in small populations, where men live in more
        intimate relations. Many of the most splendid outbursts of moral
        enthusiasm may be traced to an overwhelming force of conviction
        rarely found in very cultivated minds, which are keenly sensible to
        possibilities of error, conflicting arguments, and qualifying
        circumstances. Civilisation has on the whole been more successful in
        repressing crime than in repressing vice. It is very favourable to
        the gentler, charitable, and social virtues, and, where slavery does
        not exist, to the industrial virtues, and it is the especial nurse of
        the intellectual virtues; but it is in general not equally favourable
        to the production of self-sacrifice, enthusiasm, reverence, or
        chastity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moral changes,
        however, which are effected by civilisation may ultimately be
        ascribed chiefly to intellectual causes, for these lie at the root of
        the whole structure of civilised life. Sometimes, as we have seen,
        intellectual causes act directly, but more frequently they have only
        an indirect influence, producing habits of life which in their turn
        produce new conceptions of duty. The morals of men are more governed
        by their pursuits than by their opinions. A type of virtue is first
        formed by circumstances, and men afterwards make it the model upon
        which their theories are framed. Thus geographical or other
        circumstances, that make one nation military and another industrial,
        will produce in each <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg
        151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
        realised type of excellence, and corresponding conceptions about the
        relative importance of different virtues widely different from those
        which are produced in the other, and this may be the case although
        the amount of knowledge in the two communities is substantially
        equal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having discussed
        these questions as fully as the nature of my subject requires, I will
        conclude this chapter by noticing a few very prevalent errors in the
        moral judgments of history, and will also endeavour to elucidate some
        important consequences that may be deduced from the nature of moral
        types.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
        that the moral standard of most men is much lower in political
        judgments than in private matters in which their own interests are
        concerned. There is nothing more common than for men who in private
        life are models of the most scrupulous integrity to justify or excuse
        the most flagrant acts of political dishonesty and violence; and we
        should be altogether mistaken if we argued rigidly from such
        approvals to the general moral sentiments of those who utter them.
        Not unfrequently too, by a curious moral paradox, political crimes
        are closely connected with national virtues. A people who are
        submissive, gentle, and loyal, fall by reason of these very qualities
        under a despotic government; but this uncontrolled power has never
        failed to exercise a most pernicious influence on rulers, and their
        numerous acts of rapacity and aggression being attributed in history
        to the nation they represent, the national character is wholly
        misinterpreted.<a id="noteref_146" name="noteref_146" href=
        "#note_146"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">146</span></span></a> There
        are also particular kinds both of virtue and of vice which appear
        prominently before the world, while others of at least equal
        influence almost escape the notice of history. Thus, for example, the
        sectarian animosities, the horrible persecutions, the blind hatred of
        progress, the ungenerous support of every galling disqualification
        and restraint, the intense class selfishness, the obstinately
        protracted defence of intellectual <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page152">[pg 152]</span><a name="Pg152" id="Pg152" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and political superstition, the childish but
        whimsically ferocious quarrels about minute dogmatic distinctions, or
        dresses, or candlesticks, which constitute together the main features
        of ecclesiastical history, might naturally, though very unjustly,
        lead men to place the ecclesiastical type in almost the lowest rank,
        both intellectually and morally. These are, in fact, the displays of
        ecclesiastical influence which stand in bold relief in the pages of
        history. The civilising and moralising influence of the clergyman in
        his parish, the simple, unostentatious, unselfish zeal with which he
        educates the ignorant, guides the erring, comforts the sorrowing,
        braves the horrors of pestilence, and sheds a hallowing influence
        over the dying hour, the countless ways in which, in his little
        sphere, he allays evil passions, and softens manners, and elevates
        and purifies those around him—all these things, though very evident
        to the detailed observer, do not stand out in the same vivid
        prominence in historical records, and are continually forgotten by
        historians. It is always hazardous to argue from the character of a
        corporation to the character of the members who compose it, but in no
        other case is this method of judgment so fallacious as in the history
        of ecclesiastics, for there is no other class whose distinctive
        excellences are less apparent, and whose mental and moral defects are
        more glaringly conspicuous in corporate action. In different nations,
        again, the motives of virtue are widely different, and serious
        misconceptions arise from the application to one nation of the
        measure of another. Thus the chief national virtues of the French
        people result from an intense power of sympathy, which is also the
        foundation of some of their most beautiful intellectual qualities, of
        their social habits, and of their unrivalled influence in Europe. No
        other nation has so habitual and vivid a sympathy with great
        struggles for freedom beyond its border. No other literature exhibits
        so expansive and œcumenical a genius, or expounds so skilfully, or
        appreciates so generously, foreign ideas. In hardly any other land
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153"
        id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> would a disinterested war for
        the support of a suffering nationality find so large an amount of
        support. The national crimes of France are many and grievous, but
        much will be forgiven her because she loved much. The Anglo-Saxon
        nations, on the other hand, though sometimes roused to strong but
        transient enthusiasm, are habitually singularly narrow,
        unappreciative, and unsympathetic. The great source of their national
        virtue is the sense of duty, the power of pursuing a course which
        they believe to be right, independently of all considerations of
        sympathy or favour, of enthusiasm or success. Other nations have far
        surpassed them in many qualities that are beautiful, and in some
        qualities that are great. It is the merit of the Anglo-Saxon race
        that beyond all others it has produced men of the stamp of a
        Washington or a Hampden; men careless, indeed, for glory, but very
        careful of honour; who made the supreme majesty of moral rectitude
        the guiding principle of their lives, who proved in the most trying
        circumstances that no allurements of ambition, and no storms of
        passion, could cause them to deviate one hair's breadth from the
        course they believed to be their duty. This was also a Roman
        characteristic—especially that of Marcus Aurelius. The unweary,
        unostentatious, and inglorious crusade of England against slavery may
        probably be regarded as among the three or four perfectly virtuous
        pages comprised in the history of nations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although it cannot
        be said that any virtue is the negation of another, it is undoubtedly
        true that virtues are naturally grouped according to principles of
        affinity or congruity, which are essential to the unity of the type.
        The heroical, the amiable, the industrial, the intellectual virtues
        form in this manner distinct groups; and in some cases the
        development of one group is incompatible, not indeed with the
        existence, but with the prominence of others. Content cannot be the
        leading virtue in a society animated by an intense industrial spirit,
        nor submission nor tolerance of injuries in a society <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> formed upon a military type, nor
        intellectual virtues in a society where a believing spirit is made
        the essential of goodness, yet each of these conditions is the
        special sphere of some particular class of virtues. The distinctive
        beauty of a moral type depends not so much on the elements of which
        it is composed, as on the proportions in which those elements are
        combined. The characters of Socrates, of Cato, of Bayard, of Fénelon,
        and of St. Francis are all beautiful, but they differ generically,
        and not simply in degrees of excellence. To endeavour to impart to
        Cato the distinctive charm of St. Francis, or to St. Francis that of
        Cato, would be as absurd as to endeavour to unite in a single statue
        the beauties of the Apollo and the Laocoon, or in a single landscape
        the beauties of the twilight and of the meridian sun. Take away pride
        from the ancient Stoic or the modern Englishman, and you would have
        destroyed the basis of many of his noblest virtues, but humility was
        the very principle and root of the moral qualities of the monk. There
        is no quality virtuous in a woman that is not also virtuous in a man,
        yet that disposition or hierarchy of virtues which constitutes a
        perfect woman would be wholly unsuited for a perfect man. The moral
        is in this respect like the physical type. The beauty of man is not
        the beauty of woman, nor the beauty of the child as the beauty of the
        adult, nor the beauty of an Italian as the beauty of an Englishwoman.
        All types of character are not good, as all types of countenance are
        not beautiful; but there are many distinct casts of goodness, as
        there are many distinct casts of beauty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This most
        important truth may be stated in a somewhat different form. Whenever
        a man is eminently deficient in any virtue, it, of course, follows
        that his character is imperfect, but it does not necessarily follow
        that he is not in other respects moral and virtuous. There is,
        however, usually some one virtue, which I may term rudimentary, which
        is brought forward so prominently before the world, as the first
        condition <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg
        155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        moral excellence, that it may be safely inferred that a man who has
        absolutely neglected it is entirely indifferent to moral culture.
        Rudimentary virtues vary in different ages, nations, and classes.
        Thus, in the great republics of antiquity patriotism was rudimentary,
        for it was so assiduously cultivated, that it appeared at once the
        most obvious and the most essential of duties. Among ourselves much
        private virtue may co-exist with complete indifference to national
        interests. In the monastic period, and in a somewhat different form
        in the age of chivalry, a spirit of reverential obedience was
        rudimentary, and the basis of all moral progress; but we may now
        frequently find a good man without it, his moral energies having been
        cultivated in other directions. Common truthfulness and honesty, as I
        have already said, are rudimentary virtues in industrial societies,
        but not in others. Chastity, in England at least, is a rudimentary
        female virtue, but scarcely a rudimentary virtue among men, and it
        has not been in all ages, and is not now in all countries,
        rudimentary among women. There is no more important task devolving
        upon a moral historian, than to discover in each period the
        rudimentary virtue, for it regulates in a great degree the position
        assigned to all others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
        considerations I have urged, it will appear that there is
        considerable danger in proposing too absolutely a single character,
        however admirable, as the model to which all men must necessarily
        conform. A character may be perfect in its own kind, but no character
        can possibly embrace all types of perfection; for, as we have seen,
        the perfection of a type depends not only upon the virtues that
        constitute it, but also upon the order and prominence assigned to
        them. All that can be expected in an ideal is, that it should be
        perfect of its own kind, and should exhibit the type most needed in
        its age, and most widely useful to mankind. The Christian type is the
        glorification of the amiable, as the Stoic type was that of the
        heroic qualities, and this is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> one of the reasons why Christianity is so much
        more fitted than Stoicism to preside over civilisation, for the more
        society is organised and civilised, the greater is the scope for the
        amiable, and the less for the heroic qualities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The history of
        that moral intolerance which endeavours to reduce all characters to a
        single type has never, I think, been examined as it deserves, and I
        shall frequently have occasion to advert to it in the following
        pages. No one can have failed to observe how common it is for men to
        make their own tastes or excellences the measure of all goodness,
        pronouncing all that is broadly different from them to be imperfect
        or low, or of a secondary value. And this, which is usually
        attributed to vanity, is probably in most cases much more due to
        feebleness of imagination, to the difficulty most men have in
        conceiving in their minds an order of character fundamentally
        different from their own. A good man can usually sympathise much more
        with a very imperfect character of his own type than with a far more
        perfect one of a different type. To this cause, quite as much as to
        historical causes or occasional divergences of interest, may be
        traced the extreme difficulty of effecting cordial international
        friendships, especially in those cases when a difference of race
        coincides with the difference of nationality. Each nation has a
        distinct type of excellence, each esteems the virtues in which it
        excels, and in which its neighbours are often most deficient,
        incomparably the greatest. Each regards with especial antipathy the
        vices from which it is most free, and to which its neighbours maybe
        most addicted. Hence arises a mingled feeling of contempt and
        dislike, from which the more enlightened minds are, indeed, soon
        emancipated, but which constitutes the popular sentiment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The type of
        character of every individual depends partly upon innate temperament
        and partly upon external circumstances. A warlike, a refined, an
        industrial society each evokes and requires its specific qualities,
        and produces its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg
        157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        appropriate type. If a man of a different type arise—if, for example,
        a man formed by nature to exhibit to the highest perfection the
        virtues of gentleness or meekness, be born in the midst of a fierce
        military society—he will find no suitable scope for action, he will
        jar with his age, and his type will be regarded with disfavour. And
        the effect of this opposition is not simply that he will not be
        appreciated as he deserves, he will also never succeed in developing
        his own distinctive virtues as they would have been developed under
        other circumstances. Everything will be against him—the force of
        education, the habits of society, the opinions of mankind, even his
        own sense of duty. All the highest models of excellence about him
        being formed on a different type, his very efforts to improve his
        being will dull the qualities in which nature intended him to excel.
        If, on the other hand, a man with naturally heroic qualities be born
        in a society which pre-eminently values heroism, he will not only be
        more appreciated, he will also, under the concurrence of favourable
        circumstances, carry his heroism to a far higher point than would
        otherwise have been possible. Hence changing circumstances produce
        changing types, and hence, too, the possibility of moral history and
        the necessity of uniting it with general history. Religions,
        considered as moral teachers, are realised and effective only when
        their moral teaching is in conformity with the tendency of their age.
        If any part of it is not so, that part will be either openly
        abandoned, or refined away, or tacitly neglected. Among the ancients,
        the co-existence of the Epicurean and Stoical schools, which offered
        to the world two entirely different archetypes of virtue, secured in
        a very remarkable manner the recognition of different kinds of
        excellence; for although each of these schools often attained a
        pre-eminence, neither ever succeeded in wholly destroying or
        discrediting the other.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the two
        elements that compose the moral condition of mankind, our generalised
        knowledge is almost restricted to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> one. We know much of the ways in which
        political, social, or intellectual causes act upon character, but
        scarcely anything of the laws that govern innate disposition, of the
        reasons and extent of the natural moral diversities of individuals or
        races. I think, however, that most persons who reflect upon the
        subject will conclude that the progress of medicine, revealing the
        physical causes of different moral predispositions, is likely to
        place a very large measure of knowledge on this point within our
        reach. Of all the great branches of human knowledge, medicine is that
        in which the accomplished results are most obviously imperfect and
        provisional, in which the field of unrealised possibilities is most
        extensive, and from which, if the human mind were directed to it, as
        it has been during the past century to locomotive and other
        industrial inventions, the most splendid results might be expected.
        Our almost absolute ignorance of the causes of some of the most fatal
        diseases, and the empirical nature of nearly all our best medical
        treatment, have been often recognised. The medicine of inhalation is
        still in its infancy, and yet it is by inhalation that Nature
        produces most of her diseases, and effects most of her cures. The
        medical power of electricity, which of all known agencies bears most
        resemblance to life, is almost unexplored. The discovery of
        anæsthetics has in our own day opened out a field of inestimable
        importance, and the proved possibility, under certain physical
        conditions, of governing by external suggestions the whole current of
        the feelings and emotions, may possibly contribute yet further to the
        alleviation of suffering, and perhaps to that euthanasia which Bacon
        proposed to physicians as an end of their art. But in the eyes both
        of the philanthropist and of the philosopher, the greatest of all
        results to be expected in this, or perhaps any other field, are, I
        conceive, to be looked for in the study of the relations between our
        physical and our moral natures. He who raises moral pathology to a
        science, expanding, systematising, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and applying many fragmentary observations that
        have been already made, will probably take a place among the master
        intellects of mankind. The fastings and bleedings of the mediæval
        monk, the medicines for allaying or stimulating the sensual passions,
        the treatment of nervous diseases, the moral influences of insanity
        and of castration, the researches of phrenology, the moral changes
        that accompany the successive stages of physical developments, the
        instances of diseases which have altered, sometimes permanently, the
        whole complexion of the character, and have acted through the
        character upon all the intellectual judgments,<a id="noteref_147"
        name="noteref_147" href="#note_147"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">147</span></span></a> are
        examples of the kind of facts with which such a science would deal.
        Mind and body are so closely connected that even those who most
        earnestly protest against materialism readily admit that each acts
        continually upon the other. The sudden emotion that quickens the
        pulse, and blanches or flushes the cheek, and the effect of fear in
        predisposing to an epidemic, are familiar instances of the action of
        the mind upon the body, and the more powerful and permanent influence
        of the body upon the disposition is attested by countless
        observations. It is probable that this action extends to all parts of
        our moral constitution, that every passion or characteristic tendency
        has a physical predisposing cause, and that if we were acquainted
        with these, we might treat by medicine the many varieties of moral
        disease as systematically as we now treat physical disease. In
        addition to its incalculable practical importance, such knowledge
        would have a great philosophical value, throwing a new light upon the
        filiation of our moral qualities, enabling us to treat exhaustively
        the moral influence of climate, and withdrawing the great question of
        the influence of race from the impressions of isolated observers to
        place it on the firm basis of experiment. It <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class=

        of the historian.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such discoveries
        are, however, perhaps far from attainment, and their discussion does
        not fall within the compass of this work. My present object is simply
        to trace the action of external circumstances upon morals, to examine
        what have been the moral types proposed as ideal in different ages,
        in what degree they have been realised in practice, and by what
        causes they have been modified, impaired, or destroyed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the first
        facts that must strike a student who examines the ethical teaching of
        the ancient civilisations is how imperfectly that teaching was
        represented, and how feebly it was influenced by the popular creed.
        The moral ideas had at no time been sought in the actions of the
        gods, and long before the triumph of Christianity, polytheism had
        ceased to have any great influence upon the more cultivated
        intellects of mankind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Greece we may
        trace from the earliest time the footsteps of a religion of nature,
        wholly different from the legends of the mythology. The language in
        which the first Greek dramatists asserted the supreme authority and
        universal providence of Zeus was so emphatic, that the Christian
        Fathers commonly attributed it either to direct inspiration or to a
        knowledge of the Jewish writings, while later theologians of the
        school of Cudworth have argued from it in favour of the original
        monotheism of our race. The philosophers were always either
        contemptuous or hostile to the prevailing legends. Pythagoras is said
        to have declared that he had seen Hesiod tied to a brazen pillar in
        hell, and Homer hung upon a tree surrounded by serpents, on account
        of the fables they had invented about the gods.<a id="noteref_148"

        attaining any sure knowledge, either human or divine. The Cynic
        Antisthenes said that there were many popular gods, but there was
        only one god of nature.<a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href=

        believed in an all-pervading soul of nature, but unlike some modern
        schools which have adopted this view, they asserted in emphatic
        language the doctrine of Providence, and the self-consciousness of
        the Deity.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Roman
        republic and empire, a general scepticism had likewise arisen among
        the philosophers as the first fruit of intellectual development, and
        the educated classes were speedily divided between avowed or virtual
        atheists, like the Epicureans,<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155"
        href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a> and
        pure theists, like the Stoics and the Platonists. The first,
        represented by such writers as Lucretius and Petronius, regarded the
        gods simply as the creations of fear, denied every form of
        Providence, attributed the world <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to a concurrence of atoms, and life to
        spontaneous generation, and regarded it as the chief end of
        philosophy to banish as illusions of the imagination every form of
        religious belief. The others formed a more or less pantheistic
        conception of the Deity, asserted the existence of a
        Providence,<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href=
        "#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        treated with great contempt the prevailing legends which they
        endeavoured in various ways to explain. The first systematic theory
        of explanation appears to have been that of the Sicilian Euhemerus,
        whose work was translated by Ennius. He pretended that the gods were
        originally kings, whose history and genealogies he professed to
        trace, and who after death had been deified by mankind.<a id=

        attempt, which in the first period of Roman scepticism was more
        generally popular, was that of some of the Stoics, who regarded the
        gods as personifications of the different attributes of the Deity, or
        of different forces of nature. Thus Neptune was the sea, Pluto was
        fire, Hercules represented the strength of God, Minerva His wisdom,

        Quintilian defended the subjugation of the world beneath the sceptre
        of a single man, on the ground that it was an image of the government
        of God. Other philosophers contented themselves with asserting the
        supreme authority of Jupiter Maximus, and reducing the other
        divinities to mere administrative and angelic functions, or, as the
        Platonists expressed it, to the position of dæmons. According to some

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These examples
        will be sufficient to show how widely the philosophic classes in Rome
        were removed from the professed religion of the State, and how
        necessary it is to seek elsewhere the sources of their moral life.
        But the opinions of learned men never reflect faithfully those of the
        vulgar, and the chasm between the two classes was even wider than at
        present before the dawn of Christianity and the invention of
        printing. The atheistic enthusiasm of Lucretius and the sceptical
        enthusiasm of some of the disciples of Carneades were isolated
        phenomena, and the great majority of the ancient philosophers, while
        speculating with the utmost freedom in private, or in writings that
        were read by the few, countenanced, practised, and even defended the
        religious rites that they despised. It was believed that many
        different paths adapted to different nations and grades of knowledge
        converge to the same Divinity, and that the most erroneous religion
        is good if it forms good dispositions and inspires virtuous actions.
        The oracle of Delphi had said that the best religion is that of a
        man's own city. Polybius and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, who regarded
        all religions simply as political agencies, dilated in rapturous
        terms upon the devotion of the Romans and the comparative purity of
        their creed.<a id="noteref_177" name="noteref_177" href=

        an independent source of moral enthusiasm. It was the creature of the
        State, and derived its inspiration from political feeling. The Roman
        gods were not, like those of the Greeks, the creations of an
        unbridled and irreverent fancy, nor, like those of the Egyptians,
        representations of the forces of nature; they were for the most part
        simple allegories, frigid personifications of different virtues, or
        presiding spirits imagined for the protection of different
        departments of industry. The religion established the sanctity of an
        oath, it gave a kind of official consecration to certain virtues, and
        commemorated special instances in which they had been displayed; its
        local character strengthened patriotic feeling, its worship of the
        dead fostered a vague belief in the immortality of the soul,<a id=

        sustained the supremacy of the father in the family, surrounded
        marriage with many imposing solemnities, and created simple and
        reverent characters profoundly submissive to an over-ruling
        Providence and scrupulously observant of sacred rites. But with all
        this it was purely selfish. It was simply a method of obtaining
        prosperity, averting calamity, and reading the future. Ancient Rome
        produced many heroes, but no saint. Its self-sacrifice was patriotic,
        not religious. Its religion was neither an independent teacher nor a
        source of inspiration, although its rites mingled with and
        strengthened some of the best habits of the people.</p>

        had dissolved or effaced all the old bonds of virtue. The simple
        juxtaposition of many forms of worship effected what could not have
        been effected by the most sceptical literature or the most audacious
        philosophy. The moral influence of religion was almost annihilated.

        of the old religion. The apotheosis of the emperors consummated its
        degradation. The foreign gods were identified with those of Rome, and

        Plutarch tells of a spectator at a theatre rising up with indignation
        after a recital of the crimes of Diana, and exclaiming to the actor,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“May you have a daughter like her whom you

        were still profoundly superstitious, but they resorted to each new
        religion as to a charm or talisman of especial power, or a system of
        magic revealing the future. There existed, too, to a very large
        extent, a kind of superstitious scepticism which occupies a very
        prominent place in religious history. There were multitudes who,
        declaring that there were no gods, or that the gods never interfered
        with human affairs, professed with the same breath an absolute faith
        in all portents, auguries, dreams, and miracles. Innumerable natural
        objects, such as comets, meteors, earthquakes, or monstrous births,
        were supposed to possess a kind of occult or magical virtue, by which
        they foreshadowed, and in some cases influenced, <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the destinies of men. Astrology, which is
        the special representative of this mode of thought, rose to great
        prominence. The elder Pliny notices that in his time a belief was
        rapidly gaining ground, both among the learned and among the vulgar,
        that the whole destiny of man is determined by the star that presides
        over his nativity; that God, having ordained this, never interferes
        with human affairs, and that the reality of the portents is due to
        this pre-ordainment.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href=

        the later historians of the Empire remarks that numbers who denied
        the existence of any divinity believed nevertheless that they could
        not safely appear in public, or eat or bathe, unless they had first
        carefully consulted the almanac to ascertain the position of the
        planet Mercury, or how far the moon was from the Crab.<a id=

        perhaps, among the peasants in the country districts, the Roman
        religion, in the last years of the Republic, and in the first century
        of the Empire, scarcely existed, except in the state of a
        superstition, and he who would examine the true moral influence of
        the time must turn to the great schools of philosophy which had been
        imported from Greece.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The vast place
        which the rival systems of Zeno and Epicurus occupy in the moral
        history of mankind, and especially in the closing years of the empire
        of paganism, may <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
        172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        easily lead us to exaggerate the creative genius of their founders,
        who, in fact, did little more than give definitions or intellectual
        expression to types of excellence that had at all times existed in
        the world. There have ever been stern, upright, self-controlled, and
        courageous men, actuated by a pure sense of duty, capable of high
        efforts of self-sacrifice, somewhat intolerant of the frailties of
        others, somewhat hard and unsympathising in the ordinary intercourse
        of society, but rising to heroic grandeur as the storm lowered upon
        their path, and more ready to relinquish life than the cause they
        believed to be true. There have also always been men of easy tempers
        and of amiable disposition, gentle, benevolent, and pliant, cordial
        friends and forgiving enemies, selfish at heart, yet ever ready, when
        it is possible, to unite their gratifications with those of others,
        averse to all enthusiasm, mysticism, utopias, and superstition, with
        little depth of character or capacity for self-sacrifice, but
        admirably fitted to impart and to receive enjoyment, and to render
        the course of life easy and harmonious. The first are by nature
        Stoics, and the second Epicureans, and if they proceed to reason
        about the <span lang="la" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "la"><span style="font-style: italic">summum bonum</span></span> or
        the affections, it is more than probable that in each case their
        characters will determine their theories. The first will estimate
        self-control above all other qualities, will disparage the
        affections, and will endeavour to separate widely the ideas of duty
        and of interest, while the second will systematically prefer the
        amiable to the heroic, and the utilitarian to the mystical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while it is
        undoubtedly true that in these matters character usually determines
        opinion, it is not less true that character is itself in a great
        measure governed by national circumstances. The refined, artistic,
        sensual civilisations of Greece and Asia Minor might easily produce
        fine examples of the Epicurean type, but Rome was from the earliest
        times pre-eminently the home of stoicism. Long before the Romans had
        begun to reason about philosophy, they had exhibited it in
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173"
        id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> action, and in their
        speculative days it was to this doctrine that the noblest minds
        naturally tended. A great nation engaged in perpetual wars in an age
        when success in warfare depended neither upon wealth nor upon
        mechanical genius, but upon the constant energy of patriotic
        enthusiasm, and upon the unflinching maintenance of military
        discipline, the whole force of the national character tended to the
        production of a single definite type. In the absolute authority
        accorded to the father over the children, to the husband over the
        wife, to the master over the slave, we may trace the same habits of
        discipline that proved so formidable in the field. Patriotism and
        military honour were indissolubly connected in the Roman mind. They
        were the two sources of national enthusiasm, the chief ingredients of
        the national conception of greatness. They determined irresistibly
        the moral theory which was to prove supreme.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now war, which
        brings with it so many demoralising influences, has, at least, always
        been the great school of heroism. It teaches men how to die. It
        familiarises the mind with the idea of noble actions performed under
        the influence, not of personal interest, but of honour and of
        enthusiasm. It elicits in the highest degree strength of character,
        accustoms men to the abnegation needed for simultaneous action,
        compels them to repress their fears, and establish a firm control
        over their affections. Patriotism, too, leads them to subordinate
        their personal wishes to the interests of the society in which they
        live. It extends the horizon of life, teaching men to dwell among the
        great men of the past, to derive their moral strength from the study
        of heroic lives, to look forward continually, through the vistas of a
        distant future, to the welfare of an organisation which will continue
        when they have passed away. All these influences were developed in
        Roman life to a degree which can now never be reproduced. War, for
        the reasons I have stated, was far more than at present the school of
        heroic virtues. Patriotism, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg
        174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        the absence of any strong theological passion, had assumed a
        transcendent power. The citizen, passing continually from political
        to military life, exhibited to perfection the moral effects of both.
        The habits of command formed by a long period of almost universal
        empire, and by the aristocratic organisation of the city, contributed
        to the elevation, and also to the pride, of the national
        character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will appear, I
        think, sufficiently evident, from these considerations, that the
        circumstances of the Roman people tended inevitably to the production
        of a certain type of character, which, in its essential
        characteristics, was the type of stoicism. In addition to the
        predisposition which leads men in their estimate of the comparative
        excellence of different qualities to select for the highest eulogy
        those which are most congruous to their own characters, this fact
        derives a great importance from the large place which the
        biographical element occupied in ancient ethical teaching. Among
        Christians the ideals have commonly been either supernatural beings
        or men who were in constant connection with supernatural beings, and
        these men have usually been either Jews or saints, whose lives were
        of such a nature as to isolate them from most human sympathies, and
        to efface as far as possible the national type. Among the Greeks and
        Romans the examples of virtue were usually their own
        fellow-countrymen; men who had lived in the same moral atmosphere,
        struggled for the same ends, acquired their reputation in the same
        spheres, exhibited in all their intensity the same national
        characteristics as their admirers. History had assumed a didactic
        character it has now almost wholly lost. One of the first tasks of
        every moralist was to collect traits of character illustrating the
        precepts he enforced. Valerius Maximus represented faithfully the
        method of the teachers of antiquity when he wrote his book giving a
        catalogue of different moral qualities, and illustrating each by a
        profusion of examples derived from the history of his own or of
        foreign nations.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page175">[pg

        they show how naturally the highest type of national excellence
        determined the prevailing school of moral philosophy, and also how
        the influence of the heroic period of national history would act upon
        the best minds in the subsequent and wholly different phases of
        development. It was therefore not surprising that during the Empire,
        though the conditions of national life were profoundly altered,
        Stoicism should still be the philosophical religion, the great source
        and regulator of moral enthusiasm. Epicureanism had, indeed, spread
        widely in the Empire,<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href=
        "#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a> but it
        proved little more than a principle of disintegration or an apology
        for vice, or at best the religion of tranquil and indifferent natures
        animated by no strong moral enthusiasm. It is indeed true that
        Epicurus had himself been a man of the most blameless character, that
        his doctrines were at first carefully distinguished from the coarse
        sensuality of the Cyrenaic school which had preceded them, that they
        admitted in theory almost every form of virtue, and that the school
        had produced <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg
        176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        many disciples who, if they had not attained the highest grades of
        excellence, had at least been men of harmless lives, intensely
        devoted to their master, and especially noted for the warmth and
        constancy of their friendships.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198"
        href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> But a
        school which placed so high a value on ease and pleasure was
        eminently unfit to struggle against the fearful difficulties that
        beset the teachers of virtue amid the anarchy of a military
        despotism, and the virtues and the vices of the Romans were alike
        fatal to its success. All the great ideals of Roman excellence
        belonged to a different type. Such men as a Decius or a Regulus would
        have been impossible in an Epicurean society, for even if their
        actuating emotion were no nobler than a desire for posthumous fame,
        such a desire could never grow powerful in a moral atmosphere charged
        with the shrewd, placid, unsentimental utilitarianism of Epicurus. On
        the other hand, the distinctions the Epicureans had drawn between
        more or less refined pleasures and their elevated conceptions of what
        constitutes the true happiness of men, were unintelligible to the
        Romans, who knew how to sacrifice <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> enjoyment, but who, when pursuing it,
        gravitated naturally to the coarsest forms. The mission of
        Epicureanism was therefore chiefly negative. The anti-patriotic
        tendency of its teaching contributed to that destruction of national
        feeling which was necessary to the rise of cosmopolitanism, while its
        strong opposition to theological beliefs, supported by the genius and
        enthusiasm of Lucretius, told powerfully upon the decaying faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such being the
        functions of Epicureanism, the constructive or positive side of
        ethical teaching devolved almost exclusively upon Stoicism; for
        although there were a few philosophers who expressed themselves in
        strong opposition to some portions of the Stoical system, their
        efforts usually tended to no more than a modification of its extreme
        and harshest features. The Stoics asserted two cardinal
        principles—that virtue was the sole legitimate object to be aspired
        to, and that it involved so complete an ascendancy of the reason as
        altogether to extinguish the affections. The Peripatetics and many
        other philosophers, who derived their opinions chiefly from Plato,
        endeavoured to soften down the exaggeration of these principles. They
        admitted that virtue was an object wholly distinct from interest, and
        that it should be the leading motive of life; but they maintained
        that happiness was also a good, and a certain regard for it
        legitimate. They admitted that virtue consisted in the supremacy of
        the reason over the affections, but they allowed the exercise of the
        latter within restricted limits. The main distinguishing features,
        however, of Stoicism, the unselfish ideal and the controlling reason,
        were acquiesced in, and each represents an important side of the
        ancient conception of excellence which we must now proceed to
        examine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first we
        may easily trace the intellectual expression of the high spirit of
        self-sacrifice which the patriotic enthusiasm had elicited. The
        spirit of patriotism has this peculiar characteristic, that, while it
        has evoked acts of heroism <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg
        178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which are both very numerous and very sublime, it has done so without
        presenting any prospect of personal immortality as a reward. Of all
        the forms of human heroism, it is probably the most unselfish. The
        Spartan and the Roman died for his country because he loved it. The
        martyr's ecstasy of hope had no place in his dying hour. He gave up
        all he had, he closed his eyes, as he believed, for ever, and he
        asked for no reward in this world or in the next. Even the hope of
        posthumous fame—the most refined and supersensual of all that can be
        called reward—could exist only for the most conspicuous leaders. It
        was examples of this nature that formed the culminations or ideals of
        ancient systems of virtue, and they naturally led men to draw a very
        clear and deep distinction between the notions of interest and of
        duty. It may, indeed, be truly said, that while the conception of
        what constituted duty was often very imperfect in antiquity, the
        conviction that duty, as distinguished from every modification of
        selfishness, should be the supreme motive of life was more clearly
        enforced among the Stoics than in any later society.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reader will
        probably have gathered from the last chapter that there are four
        distinct motives which moral teachers may propose for the purpose of
        leading men to virtue. They may argue that the disposition of events
        is such that prosperity will attend a virtuous life, and adversity a
        vicious one—a proposition they may prove by pointing to the normal
        course of affairs, and by asserting the existence of a special
        Providence in behalf of the good in the present world, and of rewards
        and punishments in the future. As far as these latter arguments are
        concerned, the efficacy of such teaching rests upon the firmness with
        which certain theological tenets are held, while the force of the
        first considerations will depend upon the degree and manner in which
        society is organised, for there are undoubtedly some conditions of
        society in which a perfectly upright life has <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> not even a general tendency to
        prosperity. The peculiar circumstances and dispositions of
        individuals will also influence largely the way in which they receive
        such teaching, and, as Cicero observed, <span class="tei tei-q">“what
        one utility has created, another will often destroy.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They may argue,
        again, that vice is to the mind what disease is to the body, and that
        a state of virtue is in consequence a state of health. Just as bodily
        health is desired for its own sake, as being the absence of a
        painful, or at least displeasing state, so a well-ordered and
        virtuous mind may be valued for its own sake, and independently of
        all the external good to which it may lead, as being a condition of
        happiness; and a mind distracted by passion and vice may be avoided,
        not so much because it is an obstacle in the pursuit of prosperity,
        as because it is in itself essentially painful and disturbing. This
        conception of virtue and vice as states of health or sickness, the
        one being in itself a good and the other in itself an evil, was a
        fundamental proposition in the ethics of Plato.<a id="noteref_199"
        name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a> It was
        admitted, but only to a subsidiary place, by the Stoics,<a id=
        "noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a> and has
        passed more or less <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page180">[pg
        180]</span><a name="Pg180" id="Pg180" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        into all the succeeding systems. It is especially favourable to large
        and elevating conceptions of self-culture, for it leads men to dwell
        much less upon isolated acts of virtue or vice than upon the habitual
        condition of mind from which they spring.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is possible, in
        the third place, to argue in favour of virtue by offering as a motive
        that sense of pleasure which follows the deliberate performance of a
        virtuous act. This emotion is a distinct and isolated gratification
        following a distinct action, and may therefore be easily separated
        from that habitual placidity of temper which results from the
        extinction of vicious and perturbing impulses. It is this theory
        which is implied in the common exhortations to enjoy 'the luxury of
        doing good,' and though especially strong in acts of benevolence, in
        which case sympathy with the happiness created intensifies the
        feeling, this pleasure attends every kind of virtue.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These three
        motives of action have all this common characteristic, that they
        point as their ultimate end to the happiness of the agent. The first
        seeks that happiness in external circumstances; the second and third
        in psychological conditions. There is, however, a fourth kind of
        motive which may be urged, and which is the peculiar characteristic
        of the intuitive school of moralists and the stumbling-block of its
        opponents. It is asserted that we are so constituted that the notion
        of duty furnishes in itself a natural motive of action of the highest
        order, wholly distinct from all the refinements and modifications of
        self-interest. The coactive force of this motive is altogether
        independent of surrounding circumstances, and of all forms of belief.
        It is equally true for the man who believes and for the man who
        rejects the Christian faith, for the believer in a future world and
        for the believer in the mortality of the soul. It is not a question
        of happiness or unhappiness, of reward or punishment, but of a
        generically different nature. Men feel that a certain course
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181"
        id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of life is the natural end of
        their being, and they feel bound, even at the expense of happiness,
        to pursue it. They feel that certain acts are essentially good and
        noble, and others essentially base and vile, and this perception
        leads them to pursue the one and to avoid the other, irrespective of
        all considerations of enjoyment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have recurred to
        these distinctions, which were more fully discussed in the last
        chapter, because the school of philosophy we are reviewing furnishes
        the most perfect of all historical examples of the power which the
        higher of these motives can exercise over the mind. The coarser forms
        of self-interest were in stoicism absolutely condemned. It was one of
        the first principles of these philosophers that all things that are
        not in our power should be esteemed indifferent; that the object of
        all mental discipline should be to withdraw the mind from all the
        gifts of fortune, and that prudence must in consequence be altogether
        excluded from the motives of virtue. To enforce these principles they
        continually dilated upon the vanity of human things, and upon the
        majesty of the independent mind, and they indulged, though scarcely
        more than other sects, in many exaggerations about the impassive
        tranquillity of the sage.<a id="noteref_201" name="noteref_201" href=
        "#note_201"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">201</span></span></a> In the
        Roman empire stoicism flourished at a period which, beyond almost any
        other, seemed unfavourable to such teaching. There were reigns when,
        in the emphatic words of Tacitus, <span class="tei tei-q">“virtue was
        a sentence of death.”</span> In no period had brute force more
        completely triumphed, in none was the thirst for material advantages
        more intense, in very few was vice more ostentatiously glorified. Yet
        in the midst of all these circumstances the Stoics taught a
        philosophy which was not a compromise, or an attempt to moderate the
        popular excesses, but which <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg
        182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was
        rather in its austere sanctity the extreme antithesis of all that the
        prevailing examples and their own interests could dictate. And these
        men were no impassioned fanatics, fired with the prospect of coming
        glory. They were men from whose motives of action the belief in the
        immortality of the soul was resolutely excluded. In the scepticism
        that accompanied the first introduction of philosophy into Rome, in
        the dissolution of the old fables about Tartarus and the Styx, and
        the dissemination of Epicureanism among the people, this doctrine had
        sunk very low, notwithstanding the beautiful reasonings of Cicero and
        the religious faith of a few who clung like Plutarch to the mysteries
        in which it was perpetuated. An interlocutor in Cicero expressed what
        was probably a common feeling when he acknowledged that, with the
        writings of Plato before him, he could believe and realise it; but
        when he closed the book, the reasonings seemed to lose their power,
        and the world of spirits grew pale and unreal.<a id="noteref_202"

        Ennius could elicit the plaudits of a theatre when he proclaimed that

        the end of all things.<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href=

        perhaps the greatest of Roman scholars, adopting the sentiment of all

        opinions of the Stoics were wavering and uncertain. Their first
        doctrine was that the soul of man has a future and independent, but
        not <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page183">[pg 183]</span><a name=
        "Pg183" id="Pg183" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an eternal existence,
        that it survives until the last conflagration which was to destroy
        the world, and absorb all finite things into the all-pervading soul
        of nature. Chrysippus, however, restricted to the best and noblest
        souls this future existence, which Cleanthes had awarded to
        all,<a id="noteref_205" name="noteref_205" href=

        among the Roman Stoics even this was greatly doubted. The belief that
        the human soul is a detached fragment of the Deity naturally led to
        the belief that after death it would be reabsorbed into the parent
        Spirit. The doctrine that there is no real good but virtue deprived
        the Stoics of the argument for a future world derived from unrequited
        merit and unpunished crime, and the earnestness with which they
        contended that a good man should act irrespectively of reward
        inclined them, as it is said to have inclined some Jewish
        thinkers,<a id="noteref_206" name="noteref_206" href=

        left us no grander example than that of Epictetus, the sickly,
        deformed slave of a master who was notorious for his barbarity,
        enfranchised late in life, but soon driven into exile by Domitian;
        who, while sounding the very abyss of human misery, and looking
        forward to death as to simple decomposition, was yet so filled with
        the sense of the Divine presence that his life was one continued hymn
        to Providence, and his writings and his example, which appeared to
        his contemporaries almost the ideal of human goodness, have not lost

        Aurelius, following an example that is ascribed to Pythagoras, made
        it a special object of mental discipline, by continually meditating
        on death, and evoking, by an effort of the imagination, whole
        societies that had passed away, to acquire a realised sense of the
        vanity of posthumous fame. The younger Pliny painted faithfully the
        ideal of Stoicism when he described one of his friends as a man
        <span class="tei tei-q">“who did nothing for ostentation, but all for
        conscience; who sought the reward of virtue in itself, and not in the

        were the Stoics less emphatic in distinguishing the obligation from
        the attraction of virtue. It was on this point that they separated
        from the more refined Epicureans, who were often willing to sublimate
        to the highest degree the kind of pleasure they proposed as an
        object, provided only it were admitted that pleasure is necessarily
        the ultimate end of our actions. But this the Stoics firmly denied.

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
        distinguishing feature of Stoicism I have noticed was the complete
        suppression of the affections to make way for the absolute ascendancy
        of reason. There are two great divisions of character corresponding
        very nearly to the Stoical and Epicurean temperaments I have
        described—that in which the will predominates, and that in which the
        desires are supreme. A good man of the first class is one whose will,
        directed by a sense of duty, pursues the course he believes to be
        right, in spite of strong temptations to pursue an opposite course,
        arising either from his own passions and tendencies, or from the
        circumstances that surround him. A good man of the second class is
        one who is so happily constituted that his sympathies and desires
        instinctively tend to virtuous ends. The first character is the only
        one to which we can, strictly speaking, attach the idea of merit, and
        it is also the only one which is capable of rising to high efforts of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188"
        id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> continuous and heroic
        self-sacrifice; but on the other hand there is a charm in the
        spontaneous action of the unforced desires which disciplined virtue
        can perhaps never attain. The man who is consistently generous
        through a sense of duty, when his natural temperament impels him to
        avarice and when every exercise of benevolence causes him a pang,
        deserves in the very highest degree our admiration; but he whose
        generosity costs him no effort, but is the natural gratification of
        his affections, attracts a far larger measure of our love.
        Corresponding to these two casts of character, we find two distinct
        theories of education, the aim of the one being chiefly to strengthen
        the will, and that of the other to guide the desires. The principal
        examples of the first are the Spartan and Stoical systems of
        antiquity, and, with some modifications, the asceticism of the Middle
        Ages. The object of these systems was to enable men to endure pain,
        to repress manifest and acknowledged desires, to relinquish
        enjoyments, to establish an absolute empire over their emotions. On
        the other hand, there is a method of education which was never more
        prevalent than in the present day, which exhausts its efforts in
        making virtue attractive, in associating it with all the charms of
        imagination and of prosperity, and in thus insensibly drawing the
        desires in the wished-for direction. As the first system is
        especially suited to a disturbed and military society, which requires
        and elicits strong efforts of the will, and is therefore the special
        sphere of heroic virtues, so the latter belongs naturally to a
        tranquil and highly organised civilisation, which is therefore very
        favourable to the amiable qualities, and it is probable that as
        civilisation advances, the heroic type will, in consequence, become
        more and more rare, and a kind of self-indulgent goodness more
        common. The circumstances of the ancient societies led them to the
        former type, of which the Stoics furnished the extreme expression in
        their doctrine that the affections are of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nature of a disease<a id="noteref_236"
        name="noteref_236" href="#note_236"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">236</span></span></a>—a
        doctrine which they justified by the same kind of arguments as those
        which are now often employed by metaphysicians to prove that love,
        anger, and the like can only be ascribed by a figure of speech to the
        Deity. Perturbation, they contended, is necessarily imperfection, and
        none of its forms can in consequence be ascribed to a perfect being.
        We have a clear intuitive perception that reason is the highest, and
        should be the directing, power of an intelligent being; but every act
        which is performed at the instigation of the emotions is withdrawn
        from the empire of reason. Hence it was inferred that while the will
        should be educated to act habitually in the direction of virtue, even
        the emotions that seem most fitted to second it should be absolutely
        proscribed. Thus Seneca has elaborated at length the distinction
        between clemency and pity, the first being one of the highest
        virtues, and the latter a positive vice. Clemency, he says, is an
        habitual disposition to gentleness in the application of punishments.
        It is that moderation which remits something of an incurred penalty,
        it is the opposite of cruelty, which is an habitual disposition to
        rigour. Pity, on the other hand, bears to clemency the same kind of
        relation as superstition to religion. It is the weakness of a feeble
        mind that flinches at the sight of suffering. Clemency is an act of
        judgment, but pity disturbs the judgment. Clemency adjudicates upon
        the proportion between suffering and guilt. Pity contemplates only
        suffering, and gives no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
        190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        thought to its cause. Clemency, in the midst of its noblest efforts,
        is perfectly passionless; pity is unreasoning emotion. Clemency is an
        essential characteristic of the sage; pity is only suited for weak
        women and for diseased minds. <span class="tei tei-q">“The sage will
        console those who weep, but without weeping with them; he will
        succour the shipwrecked, give hospitality to the proscribed, and alms
        to the poor, ... restore the son to the mother's tears, save the
        captive from the arena, and even bury the criminal; but in all this
        his mind and his countenance will be alike untroubled. He will feel
        no pity. He will succour, he will do good, for he is born to assist
        his fellows, to labour for the welfare of mankind, and to offer to
        each one his part.... His countenance and his soul will betray no
        emotion as he looks upon the withered legs, the tattered rags, the
        bent and emaciated frame of the beggar. But he will help those who
        are worthy, and, like the gods, his leaning will be towards the
        wretched.... It is only diseased eyes that grow moist in beholding
        tears in other eyes, as it is no true sympathy, but only weakness of
        nerves, that leads some to laugh always when others laugh, or to yawn
        when others yawn.”</span><a id="noteref_237" name="noteref_237" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cicero, in a
        sentence which might be adopted as the motto of Stoicism, said that
        Homer <span class="tei tei-q">“attributed human qualities to the
        gods; it would have been better to have imparted divine qualities to
        men.”</span> The remarkable passage I have just cited serves to show
        the extremes to which the Stoics pushed this imitation. And indeed,
        if we compare the different virtues that have flourished among Pagans
        and Christians, we invariably find that the prevailing type of
        excellence among the former is that in which the will and judgment,
        and among the latter that in which the emotions, are most prominent.
        Friendship rather than love, hospitality rather than charity,
        magnanimity rather than tenderness, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page191">[pg 191]</span><a name="Pg191" id="Pg191" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> clemency rather than sympathy, are the
        characteristics of ancient goodness. The Stoics, who carried the
        suppression of the emotions farther than any other school, laboured
        with great zeal to compensate the injury thus done to the benevolent
        side of our nature, by greatly enlarging the sphere of reasoned and
        passionless philanthropy. They taught, in the most emphatic language,
        the fraternity of all men, and the consequent duty of each man
        consecrating his life to the welfare of others. They developed this
        general doctrine in a series of detailed precepts, which, for the
        range, depth, and beauty of their charity, have never been surpassed.
        They even extended their compassion to crime, and adopting the
        paradox of Plato, that all guilt is ignorance,<a id="noteref_238"
        name="noteref_238" href="#note_238"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">238</span></span></a> treated
        it as an involuntary disease, and declared that the only legitimate
        ground of punishment is prevention.<a id="noteref_239" name=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        however fully they might reconcile in theory their principles with
        the widest and most active benevolence, they could not wholly
        counteract the practical evil of a system which declared war against
        the whole emotional side of our being, and reduced human virtue to a
        kind of majestic egotism; proposing as examples Anaxagoras, who, when
        told that his son had died, simply observed, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I never supposed that I had begotten an
        immortal;”</span><a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href=
        "#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> or
        Stilpo, who, when his country had been ruined, his native city
        captured, and his daughters carried away as slaves or as concubines,
        boasted that he had lost nothing, for the sage is independent of
        circumstances. The framework or theory of <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> benevolence might be there, but the animating
        spirit was absent. Men who taught that the husband or the father
        should look with perfect indifference on the death of his wife or his
        child, and that the philosopher, though he may shed tears of
        pretended sympathy in order to console his suffering friend, must
        suffer no real emotion to penetrate his breast,<a id="noteref_241"

        never found a true or lasting religion of benevolence. Men who
        refused to recognise pain and sickness as evils were scarcely likely
        to be very eager to relieve them in others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In truth, the
        Stoics, who taught that all virtue was conformity to nature, were, in
        this respect, eminently false to their own principle. Human nature,
        as revealed to us by reason, is a composite thing, a constitution of
        many parts differing in kind and dignity, a hierarchy in which many
        powers are intended to co-exist, but in different positions of
        ascendancy or subordination. To make the higher part of our nature
        our whole nature, is not to restore but to mutilate humanity, and
        this mutilation has never been attempted without producing grave
        evils. As philanthropists, the Stoics, through their passion for
        unity, were led to the extirpation of those emotions which nature
        intended as the chief springs of benevolence. As speculative
        philosophers, they were entangled by the same desire in a long train
        of pitiable paradoxes. Their famous doctrines that all virtues are
        equal, or, more correctly, are the same, that all vices are equal,
        that nothing is an evil which does not affect our will, and that pain
        and bereavement are, in consequence, no ills,<a id="noteref_242"

        frequently disregarded by the Roman Stoics, were yet sufficiently
        prominent to give their teaching something of an unnatural and
        affected appearance. Prizing only a single object, and developing
        only a single side of their nature, their minds became narrow and
        their views contracted. Thus, while the Epicureans, urging men to
        study nature in order to banish superstition, endeavoured to correct
        that ignorance of physical science which was one of the chief
        impediments to the progress of the ancient mind, the Stoics for the
        most part disdained a study which was other than the pursuit of
        virtue.<a id="noteref_243" name="noteref_243" href=
        "#note_243"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        the Epicurean poet painted in magnificent language the perpetual
        progress of mankind, the Stoic was essentially retrospective, and
        exhausted his strength in vain efforts to restore the simplicity of a
        by-gone age. While, too, the school of Zeno produced many of the best
        and greatest men who have ever lived, it must be acknowledged that
        its records exhibit a rather unusual number of examples of high
        professions falsified in action, and of men who, displaying in some
        forms the most undoubted and transcendent virtue, fell in others far
        below the average of mankind. The elder Cato, who, though not a
        philosopher, was a model of philosophers, was conspicuous for his
        inhumanity to his slaves.<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href=

        was one of the most extortionate usurers of his time, and several

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">245</span></span></a> No one
        eulogised more eloquently the austere simplicity of life which
        Stoicism advocated than Sallust, who in a corrupt age was notorious
        for his rapacity. Seneca himself was constitutionally a nervous and
        timid man, endeavouring, not always with success, to support himself
        by a sublime philosophy. He guided, under circumstances of extreme
        difficulty, the cause of virtue, and his death is one of the noblest
        antiquity records; but his life was deeply marked by the taint of
        flattery, and not free from the taint of avarice, and it is unhappily
        certain that he lent his pen to conceal or varnish one of the worst
        crimes of Nero. The courage of Lucan failed signally under torture,
        and the flattery which he bestowed upon Nero, in his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pharsalia,”</span> ranks with the Epigrams of Martial as
        probably the extreme limit of sycophancy to which Roman literature
        descended.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While, too, the
        main object of the Stoics was to popularise philosophy, the high
        standard of self-control they exacted rendered their system
        exceedingly unfit for the great majority of mankind, and for the
        ordinary condition of affairs. Life is history, not poetry. It
        consists mainly of little things, rarely illumined by flashes of
        great heroism, rarely broken by great dangers, or demanding great
        exertions. A moral system, to govern society, must accommodate itself
        to common characters and mingled motives. It must be capable of
        influencing natures that can never rise to an heroic level. It must
        tincture, modify, and mitigate where it cannot eradicate or
        transform. In Christianity there are always a few persons seeking by
        continual and painful efforts to reverse or extinguish the ordinary
        feelings of humanity, but in the great majority of cases the
        influence of the religious principle upon the mind, though very real,
        is not of a nature <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg
        195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        cause any serious strain or struggle. It is displayed in a certain
        acquired spontaneity of impulse. It softens the character, purifies
        and directs the imagination, blends insensibly with the habitual
        modes of thought, and, without revolutionising, gives a tone and bias
        to all the forms of action. But Stoicism was simply a school of
        heroes. It recognised no gradations of virtue or vice. It condemned
        all emotions, all spontaneity, all mingled motives, all the
        principles, feelings, and impulses upon which the virtue of common
        men mainly depends. It was capable of acting only on moral natures
        that were strung to the highest tension, and it was therefore
        naturally rejected by the multitude.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The central
        conception of this philosophy of self-control was the dignity of man.
        Pride, which looks within, making man seek his own approbation, as
        distinguished from vanity, which looks without, and shapes its
        conduct according to the opinions of others, was not only permitted
        in Stoicism, it was even its leading moral agent. The sense of
        virtue, as I have elsewhere observed, occupies in this system much
        the same place as the sense of sin in Christianity. Sin, in the
        conception of the ancients, was simply disease, and they deemed it
        the part of a wise man to correct it, but not to dwell upon its
        circumstances. In the many disquisitions which Epictetus and others
        have left us concerning the proper frame of mind in which man should
        approach death, repentance for past sin has absolutely no place, nor
        do the ancients appear to have ever realised the purifying and
        spiritualising influence it exercises upon character. And while the
        reality of moral disease was fully recognised, while a lofty and
        indeed unattainable ideal was continually proposed, no one doubted
        the essential excellence of human nature, and very few doubted the
        possibility of man acquiring by his own will a high degree of virtue.
        In this last respect there was a wide difference between the teaching
        of the Roman moralists <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg
        196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        of the Greek poets.<a id="noteref_246" name="noteref_246" href=
        "#note_246"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">246</span></span></a> Homer
        continually represents courage, anger, and the like, as the direct
        inspiration of Heaven. Æschylus, the great poet of fatalism, regards
        every human passion as but a single link in the great chain of causes
        forged by the inexorable will of Zeus. There are, indeed, few grander
        things in poetry than his picture of the many and various motives
        that urged Clytemnestra to the slaughter of Agamemnon—revenge for her
        murdered daughter, love for Ægisthus, resentment at past breaches of
        conjugal duty, jealousy of Cassandra, all blending in that fierce
        hatred that nerved her arm against her husband's life; while above
        all this tumult of passion the solemn song of Cassandra proclaimed
        that the deed was but the decree of Heaven, the harvest of blood
        springing from the seed of crime, the accomplishment of the ancient
        curse that was destined to cling for ever to the hapless race of
        Atreus. Before the body of the murdered king, and in presence of the
        wildest paroxysms of human passion, the bystanders bowed their heads,
        exclaiming, <span class="tei tei-q">“Zeus has willed it—Zeus the
        supreme Ruler, the God who does all; for what can happen in the world
        without the will of Zeus?”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But conceptions of
        this kind had little or no place in the philosophy of Rome. The issue
        of human enterprises and the disposition of the gifts of fortune were
        recognised as under the control of Providence; but man was master of
        his own feelings, and was capable of attaining such excellence that
        he might even challenge comparison with the gods. Audacious as such
        sentiments may now appear, they were common to most schools of Roman
        moralists. <span class="tei tei-q">“We boast justly of our own
        virtue,”</span> said the eclectic Cicero, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There were,
        however, other veins of thought exhibited in stoicism which greatly
        modified and sometimes positively contradicted this view of the
        relations of man to the Deity. The theology of the Stoics was an
        ill-defined, uncertain, and somewhat inconsistent Pantheism; the
        Divinity was especially worshipped under the two aspects of
        Providence and moral goodness, and the soul of man was regarded as

        Providence, to mitigate the arrogance which one aspect of their
        teaching unquestionably displayed. But in this very attempt another
        danger was incurred, upon <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
        200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which a very large proportion of the moral systems of all ages have
        been wrecked. A doctrine which thus enjoins absolute submission to
        the decrees of Providence,<a id="noteref_270" name="noteref_270"
        href="#note_270"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        proscribes the affections, and which represents its disciples as
        altogether independent of surrounding circumstances, would in most
        conditions of society have led necessarily to quietism, and proved
        absolutely incompatible with active virtue. Fortunately, however, in
        the ancient civilisations the idea of virtue had from the earliest
        times been so indissolubly connected with that of political activity
        that the danger was for a long period altogether avoided. The State
        occupied in antiquity a prominence in the thoughts of men which it
        never has attained in modern times. The influence of patriotism
        thrilled through every fibre of moral and intellectual life. The most
        profound philosophers, the purest moralists, the most sublime poets,
        had been soldiers or statesmen. Hence arose the excessive
        predominance occasionally accorded to civic virtues in ancient
        systems of ethics, and also not a few of their most revolting
        paradoxes. Plato advocated community of wives mainly on the ground
        that the children produced would be attached more exclusively to
        their country.<a id="noteref_271" name="noteref_271" href=
        "#note_271"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Aristotle may be almost said to have made the difference between
        Greek and barbarian the basis of his moral code. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page201">[pg 201]</span><a name="Pg201" id="Pg201"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The Spartan legislation was continually
        extolled as an ideal, as the Venetian constitution by the writers of
        the seventeenth century. On the other hand, the contact of the
        spheres of speculation and of political activity exercised in one
        respect a very beneficial influence upon ancient philosophies.
        Patriotism almost always occupied a prominence in the scale of
        duties, which forms a striking contrast to the neglect or discredit
        into which it has fallen among modern teachers. We do, indeed, read
        of an Anaxagoras pointing to heaven as to his true country, and
        pronouncing exile to be no evil, as the descent to the infernal
        regions is the same from every land;<a id="noteref_272" name=
        "noteref_272" href="#note_272"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">272</span></span></a> but
        such sentiments, though not unknown among the Epicureans and the
        Cynics, were diametrically opposed to the prevailing tone. Patriotism
        was represented as a moral duty, and a duty of the highest order.
        Cicero only echoed the common opinion of antiquity in that noble
        passage, in which he asserts that the love we owe our country is even
        holier and more profound than that we owe our nearest kinsman, and
        that he can have no claim to the title of a good man who even
        hesitates to die in its behalf.<a id="noteref_273" name="noteref_273"
        href="#note_273"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A necessary
        consequence of this prominence of patriotism was the practical
        character of most ancient ethics. We find, indeed, moralists often
        exhorting men to moderate their ambition, consoling them under
        political adversity, and urging that there are some circumstances
        under which an upright man should for a time withdraw from public
        affairs;<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href=
        "#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> but the
        general duty of taking part in political life was emphatically
        asserted, and the vanity of the quietist theory of life not only
        maintained, but even somewhat exaggerated. Thus <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Cicero declared that <span class=

        younger Pliny mentions that he once lamented to the Stoic Euphrates
        the small place which his official duties left for philosophical
        pursuits; but Euphrates answered that the discharge of public affairs
        and the administration of justice formed a part, and the most
        important part, of philosophy, for he who is so engaged is but
        practising the precepts of the schools.<a id="noteref_276" name=
        "noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> It was
        a fundamental maxim of the Stoics that humanity is a body in which
        each limb should act solely and continually with a view to the
        interests of the whole. Marcus Aurelius, the purest mind of the sect,
        was for nineteen years the active ruler of the civilised globe.
        Thrasea, Helvidius, Cornutus, and a crowd of others who had adopted
        Stoicism as a religion, lived, and in many cases died, in obedience
        to its precepts, struggling for the liberties of their country in the
        darkest hours of tyranny.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Men who had formed
        such high conceptions of duty, who had bridled so completely the
        tumult of passion, and whose lives were spent in a calm sense of
        virtue and of dignity, were little likely to be assailed by the
        superstitious fears that are the nightmare of weaker men. The
        preparation for death was deemed one of the chief ends of
        philosophy.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href=
        "#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a> The
        thought of a coming change assisted the mind in detaching itself from
        the gifts of fortune, and the extinction of all superstitious terrors
        completed the type of self-reliant majesty which Stoicism had chosen
        for its ideal. But while it is certain that no philosophers
        expatiated upon death with a grander eloquence, or met it with a more
        placid courage, it can hardly be denied that their constant
        disquisitions forced it into an unhealthy prominence, and somewhat
        discoloured their whole view of life. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        Stoics,”</span> as Bacon has said, <span class="tei tei-q">“bestowed
        too much cost on death, and by their preparations <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203"

        is a profound wisdom in the maxims of Spinoza, that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the proper study of a wise man is not how to die, but
        how to live,”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“there is no

        of active duty is the best preparation for the end, and so large a
        part of the evil of death lies in its anticipation, that an attempt
        to deprive it of its terrors by constant meditation almost
        necessarily defeats its object, while at the same time it forms an
        unnaturally tense, feverish, and tragical character, annihilates the
        ambition and enthusiasm that are essential to human progress, and not
        unfrequently casts a chill and a deadness over the affections.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the many
        half-pagan legends that were connected with Ireland during the middle
        ages, one of the most beautiful is that of the islands of life and of
        death. In a certain lake in Munster it is said there were two
        islands; into the first death could never enter, but age and
        sickness, and the weariness of life, and the paroxysms of fearful
        suffering were all known there, and they did their work till the
        inhabitants, tired of their immortality, learned to look upon the
        opposite island as upon a haven of repose: they launched their barks
        upon the gloomy waters; they touched its shore and they were at
        rest.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href=
        "#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This legend, which
        is far more akin to the spirit of paganism than to that of
        Christianity, and is in fact only another form of the myth of
        Tithonus, represents with great fidelity the aspect in which death
        was regarded by the exponents of Stoicism. There was much difference
        of opinion and of certitude in the judgments of the ancient
        philosophers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
        204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        concerning the future destinies of the soul, but they were unanimous
        in regarding death simply as a natural rest, and in attributing the
        terrors that were connected with it to a diseased imagination. Death,
        they said, is the only evil that does not afflict us when present.
        While we are, death is not, when death has come we are not. It is a
        false belief that it only follows, it also precedes, life. It is to
        be as we were before we were born. The candle which has been
        extinguished is in the same condition as before it was lit, and the
        dead man as the man unborn. Death is the end of all sorrow. It either
        secures happiness or ends suffering. It frees the slave from his
        cruel master, opens the prison door, calms the qualms of pain, closes
        the struggles of poverty. It is the last and best boon of nature, for
        it frees man from all his cares. It is at worst but the close of a
        banquet we have enjoyed. Whether it be desired or whether it be
        shunned, it is no curse and no evil, but simply the resolution of our
        being into its primitive elements, the law of our nature to which it
        is our duty cheerfully to conform.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
        leading topics that were employed in that beautiful literature of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Consolations,”</span> which the academic
        Crantor is said to have originated, and which occupies so large a
        place in the writings of Cicero, Plutarch, and the Stoics. Cicero,
        like all the school of Plato, added to these motives a very firm and
        constant reference to the immortality of the soul. Plutarch held the
        same doctrine with equal assurance, but he gave it a much less
        conspicuous position in his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Consolations,”</span> and he based it not upon
        philosophical grounds, but upon the testimonies of the oracles, and
        upon the mysteries of Bacchus.<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281"

        the Stoics the doctrine shone with a faint and uncertain light, and
        was seldom or never adopted as a motive. But that which is most
        impressive to a student who turns from the religious literature of
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg 205]</span><a name="Pg205"
        id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Christianity to the pagan
        philosophies, is the complete absence in the latter of all notion
        concerning the penal character of death. Death, according to
        Socrates,<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href=

        extinguishes life or emancipates it from the thraldom of the body.
        Even in the first case it is a blessing, in the last it is the
        greatest of boons. <span class="tei tei-q">“Accustom
        yourself,”</span> said Epicurus, <span class="tei tei-q">“to the
        thought that death is indifferent; for all good and all evil consist

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Souls either remain after death,”</span>
        said Cicero, <span class="tei tei-q">“or they perish in death. If

        prison, and at last enjoying his liberty, looks down from a loftier
        height on the wonders of nature and on all the deeds of men, and sees
        more clearly those divine things which he had so long sought in vain
        to understand. But why should I be afflicted for one who is either
        happy or is nothing? To lament the fate of one who is happy is envy;

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
        Greek and Roman philosophers were on this point unanimous, there was
        a strong opposing current in the popular mind. The Greek word for
        superstition signifies literally, fear of gods or dæmons, and the
        philosophers sometimes represent the vulgar as shuddering at the
        thought of death, through dread of certain endless sufferings to
        which it would lead them. The Greek mythology contains many fables on
        the subject. The early Greek vases occasionally <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page206">[pg 206]</span><a name="Pg206" id="Pg206"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> represent scenes of infernal torments,

        rapture with which Epicureanism was received, as liberating the human
        mind from the thraldom of superstitious terrors, shows how galling
        must have been the yoke. In the poem of Lucretius, in occasional
        passages of Cicero and other Latin moralists, above all, in the
        treatise of Plutarch <span class="tei tei-q">“On
        Superstition,”</span> we may trace the deep impression these terrors
        had made upon the populace, even during the later period of the
        Republic, and during the Empire. To destroy them was represented as
        the highest function of philosophy. Plutarch denounced them as the
        worst calumny against the Deity, as more pernicious than atheism, as
        the evil consequences of immoral fables, and he gladly turned to
        other legends which taught a different lesson. Thus it was related
        that when, during a certain festival at Argos, the horses that were
        to draw the statue of Juno to the temple were detained, the sons of
        the priestess yoked themselves to the car, and their mother, admiring
        their piety, prayed the goddess to reward them with whatever boon was
        the best for man. Her prayer was answered—they sank asleep and
        died.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href=
        "#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> In like
        manner the architects of the great temple of Apollo at Delphi, prayed
        the god to select that reward which was best. The oracle told them in
        reply to spend seven days in rejoicing, and on the following night
        their reward would come. They too died in sleep.<a id="noteref_288"

        questioned that a good man, reviewing his life, might look upon it
        without shame and even with positive complacency, or that the
        reverence with which men regard heroic deaths is a foretaste of the
        sentence of the Creator. To this confidence may be traced the
        tranquil courage, the complete absence of all remorse, so conspicuous
        in the closing hours of Socrates, and of many other of the sages of
        antiquity. There is no fact in religious history more startling than
        the radical change that has in this respect passed over the character
        of devotion. It is said of Chilon, one of the seven sages of Greece,
        that at the close of his career he gathered his disciples around him,
        and congratulated himself that in a long life he could recall but a
        single act that saddened his dying hour. It was that, in a perplexing
        dilemma, he had allowed his love of a friend in some slight degree to

        ancient philosophers anticipated Christian ethics, to represent
        Christianity as if it were merely a development or authoritative
        confirmation of the highest teaching of paganism, or as if the
        additions were at least of such a nature that there is but little
        doubt that the best and purest spirits of the pagan world, had they
        known them, would have gladly welcomed them. But this conception,
        which contains a large amount of truth if applied to the teaching of
        many Protestants, is either grossly exaggerated or absolutely false
        if applied to that of the patristic period or of mediæval
        Catholicism. On the very subject which the philosophers deemed the
        most important their unanimous conclusion was the extreme antithesis
        of the teaching of Catholicism. The philosophers taught that death is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a law and not a punishment;”</span><a id=
        "noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> the
        fathers taught that it is a penal infliction introduced into the
        world on account of the sin of Adam, which was also the cause of the
        appearance of all noxious plants, of all convulsions in the material
        globe, and, as was sometimes asserted, even of a diminution of the
        light of the sun. The first taught that death was the end of
        suffering; they ridiculed as the extreme of folly the notion that
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209"
        id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> physical evils could await
        those whose bodies had been reduced to ashes, and they dwelt with
        emphatic eloquence upon the approaching, and, as they believed, final
        extinction of superstitious terrors. The second taught that death to
        the vast majority of the human race is but the beginning of endless
        and excruciating tortures—tortures before which the most ghastly of
        terrestrial sufferings dwindle into insignificance—tortures which no
        courage could defy—which none but an immortal being could endure. The
        first represented man as pure and innocent until his will had sinned;
        the second represented him as under a sentence of condemnation at the
        very moment of his birth. <span class="tei tei-q">“No funeral
        sacrifices”</span> said a great writer of the first school,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“are offered for children who die at an early
        age, and none of the ceremonies practised at the funerals of adults
        are performed at their tombs, for it is believed that infants have no
        hold upon earth or upon terrestrial affections.... The law forbids us
        to honour them because it is irreligious to lament for those pure
        souls who have passed into a better life and a happier
        dwelling-place.”</span><a id="noteref_297" name="noteref_297" href=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Whosoever shall tell us,”</span> said a
        distinguished exponent of the patristic theology, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“that infants shall be quickened in Christ who die
        without partaking in His Sacrament, does both contradict the
        Apostle's teaching and condemn the whole Church.... And he that is
        not quickened in Christ must remain in that condemnation of which the
        Apostle speaks, <span class="tei tei-q">‘by one man's offence
        condemnation came upon all men to condemnation.’</span> To which
        condemnation infants are born liable as all the Church
        believes.”</span><a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href=
        "#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a> The one
        school endeavoured to plant its foundations in the moral nature of
        mankind, by proclaiming that man can become acceptable to the Deity
        by his own virtue, and by this alone, that all sacrifices, rites, and
        forms are indifferent, and that the true worship of God is the
        recognition and imitation of His <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> goodness. According to the other school, the
        most heroic efforts of human virtue are insufficient to avert a
        sentence of eternal condemnation, unless united with an implicit
        belief in the teachings of the Church, and a due observance of the
        rites it enjoins. By the philosophers the ascription of anger and
        vengeance to the Deity, and the apprehension of future torture at His
        hands, were unanimously repudiated;<a id="noteref_299" name=

        priests the opposite opinion was deemed equally censurable.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are
        fundamental points of difference, for they relate to the fundamental
        principles of the ancient philosophy. The main object of the pagan
        philosophers was to dispel the terrors the imagination had cast
        around death, and by destroying this last cause of fear to secure the
        liberty of man. The main object of the Catholic priests has been to
        make death in itself as revolting and appalling as possible, and by
        representing escape from its terrors as hopeless, except by complete
        subjection to their rule, to convert it into an instrument of
        government. By multiplying the dancing or warning skeletons, and
        other sepulchral images representing the loathsomeness of death
        without its repose; by substituting inhumation for incremation, and
        concentrating the imagination on the ghastliness of decay; above all,
        by peopling the unseen world with demon phantoms and with
        excruciating tortures, the Catholic Church succeeded in making death
        in itself unspeakably terrible, and in thus preparing men for the
        consolations it could offer. Its legends, its ceremonies, its
        art,<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href=

        dogmatic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg
        211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        teaching, all conspired to this end, and the history of its miracles
        is a striking evidence of its success. The great majority of
        superstitions have ever clustered around two centres—the fear of
        death and the belief that every phenomenon of life is the result of a
        special spiritual interposition. Among the ancients they were usually
        of the latter kind. Auguries, prophecies, interventions in war,
        prodigies avenging the neglect of some rite or marking some epoch in
        the fortunes of a nation or of a ruler, are the forms they usually
        assumed. In the middle ages, although these were very common, the
        most conspicuous superstitions took the form of visions of purgatory
        or hell, conflicts with visible demons, or Satanic miracles. Like
        those mothers who govern their children by persuading them that the
        dark is crowded with spectres that will seize the disobedient, and
        who often succeed in creating an association of ideas which the adult
        man is unable altogether to dissolve, the Catholic priests resolved
        to base their power upon the nerves; and as they long exercised an
        absolute control over education, literature, and art, they succeeded
        in completely reversing the teaching of ancient philosophy, and in
        making the terrors of death for centuries the nightmare of the
        imagination.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is, indeed,
        another side to the picture. The vague uncertainty with which the
        best pagans regarded death passed away before the teaching of the
        Church, and it was often replaced by a rapture of hope, which,
        however, the doctrine of purgatory contributed at a later period
        largely to quell. But, whatever may be thought of the justice of the
        Catholic conception of death or of its influence upon human
        happiness, it is plain that it is radically different from that of
        the pagan philosophers. That man is not only an imperfect but a
        fallen being, and that death is the penal consequence of his sin,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page212">[pg 212]</span><a name="Pg212"
        id="Pg212" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was a doctrine profoundly new
        to mankind, and it has exercised an influence of the most serious
        character upon the moral history of the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The wide
        divergence of the classical from the Catholic conception of death
        appears very plainly in the attitude which each system adopted
        towards suicide. This is, perhaps, the most striking of all the
        points of contrast between the teaching of antiquity, and especially
        of the Roman Stoics, on the one hand, and that of almost all modern
        moralists on the other. It is indeed true that the ancients were by
        no means unanimous in their approval of the act. Pythagoras, to whom
        so many of the wisest sayings of antiquity are ascribed, is said to
        have forbidden men <span class="tei tei-q">“to depart from their
        guard or station in life without the order of their commander, that
        is, of God.”</span><a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href=

        adopted similar language, though he permitted suicide when the law

        there were some who deemed it wrong, and he himself attempted to

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But,
        notwithstanding these passages, there can be no question that the
        ancient view of suicide was broadly and strongly opposed to our own.
        A general approval of it floated down through most of the schools of
        philosophy, and even to those who condemned it, it never seems to
        have assumed its present aspect of extreme enormity. This was in the
        first instance due to the ancient notion of death; and we have also
        to remember that when a society once learns to tolerate suicide, the
        deed, in ceasing to be disgraceful, loses much of its actual
        criminality, for those who are most firmly convinced that the stigma
        and suffering it now brings upon the family of the deceased do not
        constitute its entire guilt, will readily acknowledge that they
        greatly aggravate it. In the conditions of ancient thought, this
        aggravation did not exist. Epicurus exhorted men <span class=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was surnamed by the ancients <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the orator of death.”</span> A conspicuous member of
        that Cyrenaic school which esteemed the pursuit of pleasure the sole
        end of a rational being, he taught that life was so full of cares,
        and its pleasure so fleeting and so alloyed, that the happiest lot
        for man was death; and such was the power of his eloquence, so
        intense was the fascination he cast around the tomb, that his
        disciples embraced with rapture the consequence of his doctrine,
        multitudes freed themselves by suicide from the troubles of the
        world, and the contagion was so great, that Ptolemy, it is said, was
        compelled to banish the philosopher from Alexandria.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it was in the
        Roman Empire and among the Roman Stoics that suicide assumed its
        greatest prominence, and its philosophy was most fully elaborated.
        From an early period self-immolation, like that of Curtius or Decius,
        had been esteemed in some circumstances a religious rite, being, as
        has been well suggested, probably a lingering remnant of the custom
        of human sacrifices,<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href=

        towards the closing days of paganism many influences conspired in the
        same direction. The example of Cato, who had become the ideal of the

        indifference to death produced by the great multiplication of
        gladiatorial shows, the many instances of barbarian captives, who,

        raised suicide into an extraordinary prominence. Few things are more
        touching than the passionate joy with which, in the reign of Nero,
        Seneca clung to it as the one refuge for the oppressed, the last
        bulwark of the tottering mind. <span class="tei tei-q">“To death

        was hopeless, to die by his own hand. Having reasoned on the
        propriety of this course with all the tranquil courage of a Roman, he

        in one of his letters, has left us a detailed description of the
        death-bed of one of the Roman suicides. Tullius Marcellinus, a young
        man of remarkable abilities and very earnest character, who had long
        ridiculed the teachings of philosophy, but had ended by embracing it
        with all the passion of a convert, being afflicted with a grave and
        lingering though not incurable disease, resolved at length upon
        suicide. He gathered his friends around him, and many of them
        entreated him to continue in life. Among them, however, was one
        Stoical philosopher, who addressed him in what Seneca terms the very
        noblest of discourses. He exhorted him not to lay too much stress
        upon the question he was deciding, as if existence was a matter of
        great importance. He urged that life is a thing we possess in common
        with slaves and animals, but that a noble death should indeed be
        prized, and he concluded by recommending suicide. Marcellinus gladly
        embraced the counsel which his own wishes had anticipated. According
        to the advice of his friend, he distributed gifts among his faithful
        slaves, consoled them on their approaching bereavement, abstained
        dining three days from all food, and at last, when his strength had
        been wholly exhausted, passed into a warm bath and calmly died,
        describing with his last breath the pleasing sensations that
        accompanied receding life.<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346"
        href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The doctrine of
        suicide was indeed the culminating point of Roman Stoicism. The
        proud, self-reliant, unbending character of the philosopher could
        only be sustained when he felt that he had a sure refuge against the
        extreme forms of suffering or of despair. Although virtue is not a
        mere creature of interest, no great system has ever yet flourished
        which did not present an ideal of happiness as well as an ideal of
        duty. Stoicism taught men to hope little, but to fear nothing.
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223"
        id="Pg223" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> It did not array death in
        brilliant colours, as the path to positive felicity, but it
        endeavoured to divest it, as the end of suffering, of every terror.
        Life lost much of its bitterness when men had found a refuge from the
        storms of fate, a speedy deliverance from dotage and pain. Death
        ceased to be terrible when it was regarded rather as a remedy than as
        a sentence. Life and death in the Stoical system were attuned to the
        same key. The deification of human virtue, the total absence of all
        sense of sin, the proud stubborn will that deemed humiliation the
        worst of stains, appeared alike in each. The type of its own kind was
        perfect. All the virtues and all the majesty that accompany human
        pride, when developed to the highest point, and directed to the
        noblest ends, were here displayed. All those which accompany humility
        and self-abasement were absent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I desire at this
        stage of our enquiry to pause for a moment, in order to retrace
        briefly the leading steps of the foregoing argument, and thus to
        bring into the clearest light the connection which many details and
        quotations may have occasionally obscured. Such a review will show at
        a single glance in what respects Stoicism was a result of the
        pre-existent state of society, and in what respects it was an active
        agent, how far its influence was preparing the way for Christian
        ethics, and how far it was opposed to them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen,
        then, that among the Romans, as among other people, a very clear and
        definite type of moral excellence was created before men had formed
        any clear intellectual notions of the nature and sanctions of virtue.
        The characters of men are chiefly governed by their occupations, and
        the republic being organised altogether with a view to military
        success, it had attained all the virtues and vices of a military
        society. We have seen, too, that at all times, but most especially
        under the conditions of ancient warfare, military life is very
        unfavourable to the amiable, and very favourable to the heroic
        virtues. The Roman had learnt to value force <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> very highly. Being continually engaged in
        inflicting pain, his natural or instinctive humanity was very low.
        His moral feelings were almost bounded by political limits, acting
        only, and with different degrees of intensity, towards his class, his
        country, and its allies. Indomitable pride was the most prominent
        element of his character. A victorious army which is humble or
        diffident, or tolerant of insult, or anxious to take the second
        place, is, indeed, almost a contradiction of terms. The spirit of
        patriotism, in its relation to foreigners, like that of political
        liberty in its relation to governors, is a spirit of constant and
        jealous self-assertion; and although both are very consonant with
        high morality and great self-devotion, we rarely find that the grace
        of genuine humility can flourish in a society that is intensely
        pervaded by their influence. The kind of excellence that found most
        favour in Roman eyes was simple, forcible, massive, but
        coarse-grained. Subtilty of motives, refinements of feelings,
        delicacies of susceptibility, were rarely appreciated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was the
        darker side of the picture. On the other hand, the national
        character, being formed by a profession in which mercenary
        considerations are less powerful, and splendid examples of
        self-devotion more frequent, than in any other, had early risen to a
        heroic level. Death being continually confronted, to meet it with
        courage was the chief test of virtue. The habits of men were
        unaffected, frugal, honourable, and laborious. A stern discipline
        pervading all ages and classes of society, the will was trained, to
        an almost unexampled degree, to repress the passions, to endure
        suffering and opposition, to tend steadily and fearlessly towards an
        unpopular end. A sense of duty was very widely diffused, and a deep
        attachment to the interests of the city became the parent of many
        virtues.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such was the type
        of excellence the Roman people had attained at a time when its
        intellectual cultivation produced philosophical discussions, and when
        numerous Greek professors, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg
        225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        attracted partly by political events, and partly by the patronage of
        Scipio Æmilianus, arrived at Rome, bringing with them the tenets of
        the great schools of Zeno and Epicurus, and of the many minor sects
        that clustered around them. Epicureanism being essentially opposed to
        the pre-existing type of virtue, though it spread greatly, never
        attained the position of a school of virtue. Stoicism, taught by
        Panætius of Rhodes, and soon after by the Syrian Posidonius, became
        the true religion of the educated classes. It furnished the
        principles of virtue, coloured the noblest literature of the time,
        and guided all the developments of moral enthusiasm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Stoical system
        of ethics was in the highest sense a system of independent morals. It
        taught that our reason reveals to us a certain law of nature, and
        that a desire to conform to this law, irrespectively of all
        considerations of reward or punishment, of happiness or the reverse,
        is a possible and a sufficient motive of virtue. It was also in the
        highest sense a system of discipline. It taught that the will, acting
        under the complete control of the reason, is the sole principle of
        virtue, and that all the emotional part of our being is of the nature
        of a disease. Its whole tendency was therefore to dignify and
        strengthen the will, and to degrade and suppress the desires. It
        taught, moreover, that man is capable of attaining an extremely high
        degree of moral excellence, that he has nothing to fear beyond the
        present life, that it is essential to the dignity and consistence of
        his character that he should regard death without dismay, and that he
        has a right to hasten it if he desires.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is easy to see
        that this system of ethics was strictly consonant with the type of
        character the circumstances of the Roman people had formed. It is
        also manifest that while the force of circumstances had in the first
        instance secured its ascendancy, the energy of will which it produced
        would enable it to offer a powerful resistance to the tendencies of
        an altered condition of society. This was pre-eminently <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> shown in the history of Roman Stoicism.
        The austere purity of the writings of Seneca and his school is a fact
        probably unique in history, when we consider, on the one hand, the
        intense and undisguised depravity of the Empire, and on the other,
        the prominent position of most of the leading Stoics in the very
        centre of the stream. More than once in later periods did great
        intellectual brilliancy coincide with general depravity, but on none
        of these occasions was this moral phenomenon reproduced. In the age
        of Leo X., in the age of the French Regency, or of Lewis XV., we look
        in vain for high moral teaching in the centre of Italian or of
        Parisian civilisation. The true teachers of those ages were the
        reformers, who arose in obscure towns of Germany or Switzerland, or
        that diseased recluse who, from his solitude near Geneva, fascinated
        Europe by the gleams of a dazzling and almost peerless eloquence, and
        by a moral teaching which, though often feverish, paradoxical, and
        unpractical, abounded in passages of transcendent majesty and of the
        most entrancing purity and beauty. But even the best moral teachers
        who rose in the centres of the depraved society felt the contagion of
        the surrounding vice. Their ideal was depressed, their austerity was
        relaxed, they appealed to sordid and worldly motives, their judgments
        of character were wavering and uncertain, their whole teaching was of
        the nature of a compromise. But in ancient Rome, if the teachers of
        virtue acted but feebly upon the surrounding corruption, their own
        tenets were at least unstained. The splendour of the genius of Cæsar
        never eclipsed the moral grandeur of the vanquished Cato, and amid
        all the dramatic vicissitudes of civil war and of political
        convulsion, the supreme authority of moral distinctions was never
        forgotten. The eloquence of Livy was chiefly employed in painting
        virtue, the eloquence of Tacitus in branding vice. The Stoics never
        lowered their standard because of the depravity around them, and if
        we trace in their teaching any reflection <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the prevailing worship of enjoyment, it is
        only in the passionate intensity with which they dwelt upon the
        tranquillity of the tomb.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But it is not
        sufficient for a moral system to form a bulwark against vice, it must
        also be capable of admitting those extensions and refinements of
        moral sympathies which advancing civilisation produces, and the
        inflexibility of its antagonism to evil by no means implies its
        capacity of enlarging its conceptions of good. During the period
        which elapsed between the importation of Stoical tenets into Rome and
        the ascendancy of Christianity, an extremely important transformation
        of moral ideas had been effected by political changes, and it became
        a question how far the new elements could coalesce with the Stoical
        ideal, and how far they tended to replace it by an essentially
        different type. These changes were twofold, but were very closely
        connected. They consisted of the increasing prominence of the
        benevolent or amiable, as distinguished from the heroic qualities,
        and of the enlargement of moral sympathies, which having at first
        comprised only a class or a nation, came at last, by the destruction
        of many artificial barriers, to include all classes and all nations.
        The causes of these changes—which were the most important antecedents
        of the triumph of Christianity—are very complicated and numerous, but
        it will, I think, be possible to give in a few pages a sufficiently
        clear outline of the movement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It originated in
        the Roman Empire at the time when the union of the Greek and Latin
        civilisations was effected by the conquest of Greece. The general
        humanity of the Greeks had always been incomparably greater than that
        of the Romans. The refining influence of their art and literature,
        their ignorance of gladiatorial games, and their comparative freedom
        from the spirit of conquest, had separated them widely from their
        semi-barbarous conquerors, and had given a peculiar softness and
        tenderness to their ideal <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg
        228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        characters. Pericles, who, when the friends who had gathered round
        his death-bed, imagining him to be insensible, were recounting his
        splendid deeds, told them that they had forgotten his best title to
        fame—that <span class="tei tei-q">“no Athenian had ever worn mourning
        on his account;”</span> Aristides, praying the gods that those who
        had banished him might never be compelled by danger or suffering to
        recall him; Phocion, when unjustly condemned, exhorting his son never
        to avenge his death, all represent a type of character of a milder
        kind than that which Roman influences produced. The plays of
        Euripides had been to the ancient world the first great revelation of
        the supreme beauty of the gentler virtues. Among the many forms of
        worship that flourished at Athens, there was an altar which stood
        alone, conspicuous and honoured beyond all others. The suppliants
        thronged around it, but no image of a god, no symbol of dogma was
        there. It was dedicated to Pity, and was venerated through all the
        ancient world as the first great assertion among mankind of the
        supremo sanctity of Mercy.<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
        Greek spirit was from a very early period <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> distinguished for its humanity, it was at first
        as far removed from cosmopolitanism as that of Rome. It is well known
        that Phrynichus was fined because in his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Conquest of Miletus”</span> he had represented the
        triumph of barbarians over Greeks.<a id="noteref_348" name=

        successor, Æschylus, deemed it necessary to violate all dramatic
        probabilities by making the Persian king and courtiers continually
        speak of themselves as barbarians. Socrates, indeed, had proclaimed
        himself a citizen of the world,<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349"
        href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> but
        Aristotle taught that Greeks had no more duties to barbarians than to
        wild beasts, and another philosopher was believed to have evinced an
        almost excessive range of sympathy when he declared that his
        affections extended beyond his own State, and included the whole
        people of Greece. But the dissolving and disintegrating philosophical
        discussions that soon followed the death of Socrates, strengthened by
        political events, tended powerfully to destroy this feeling. The
        traditions that attached Greek philosophy to Egypt, the subsequent
        admiration for the schools of India to which Pyrrho and Anaxarchus
        are said to have resorted,<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350"
        href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a> the
        prevalence of Cynicism and Epicureanism, which agreed in inculcating
        indifference to political life, the complete decomposition of the
        popular national religions, and the incompatibility of a narrow local
        feeling with great knowledge and matured civilisation, were the
        intellectual causes of the change, and the movement of expansion
        received a great political stimulus when Alexander eclipsed the
        glories of Spartan and Athenian history by the vision of universal
        empire, accorded to the conquered nations the privileges of the
        conquerors, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is evident,
        therefore, that the prevalence of Greek ideas in Rome would be in a
        two-fold way destructive of narrow national feelings. It was the
        ascendancy of a people who were not Romans, and of a people who had
        already become in a great degree emancipated from local sentiments.
        It is also evident that the Greeks having had for several centuries a
        splendid literature, at a time when the Romans had none, and when the
        Latin language was still too rude for literary purposes, the period
        in which the Romans first emerged from a purely military condition
        into an intelligent civilisation would bring with it an ascendancy of
        Greek ideas. Fabius Pictor and Cincius Alimentus, the earliest native
        Roman historians, both wrote in Greek,<a id="noteref_352" name=
        "noteref_352" href="#note_352"><span class=

        although the poems of Ennius, and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Origines”</span> of Marcus Cato, contributed largely to
        improve and fix the Latin language, the precedent was not at once
        discontinued.<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href=

        people, whose patriotic feelings had been greatly enfeebled by the
        influences I have noticed, acquiesced readily in their new condition,
        and notwithstanding the vehement exertions of the conservative party,
        Greek manners, sentiments, and ideas soon penetrated into all
        classes, and moulded all the forms of Roman life. The elder Cato, as
        an acute observer has noticed, desired all Greek philosophers to be
        expelled from Rome. The younger Cato made Greek philosophers his most
        intimate friends.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href=

        virtue found its highest expression in Stoicism. Roman vice sheltered
        itself under the name of Epicurus. Diodorus of Sicily and Polybius
        first sketched in Greek the outlines of universal history. Dionysius
        of Halicarnassus explored Roman antiquities. Greek artists and Greek
        architects thronged the city; but the first, under Roman influence,
        abandoned the ideal for the portrait, and the second degraded the
        noble Corinthian pillar into the bastard composite.<a id=

        theatre, which now started into sudden life, was borrowed altogether
        from the Greeks. Ennius and Pacuvius imitated Euripides; Cæcilius,
        Plautus, Terence, and Nævius devoted themselves chiefly to Menander.
        Even the lover in the days of Lucretius painted his lady's charms in
        Greek.<a id="noteref_357" name="noteref_357" href=

        sums were given for Greek literary slaves, and the attractions of the

        society.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While the complete
        ascendancy of the intellect and manners of Greece was destroying the
        simplicity of the old Roman type, and at the same time enlarging the
        range of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg
        232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Roman sympathies, an equally powerful influence was breaking down the
        aristocratic and class feeling which had so long raised an
        insurmountable barrier between the nobles and the plebeians. Their
        long contentions had issued in the civil wars, the dictatorship of
        Julius Cæsar, and the Empire, and these changes in a great measure
        obliterated the old lines of demarcation. Foreign wars, which develop
        with great intensity distinctive national types, and divert the
        public mind from internal changes, are usually favourable to the
        conservative spirit; but civil wars are essentially revolutionary,
        for they overwhelm all class barriers and throw open the highest
        prizes to energy and genius. Two very remarkable and altogether
        unprecedented illustrations of this truth occurred at Rome. Ventidius
        Bassus, by his military skill, and by the friendship of Julius Cæsar,
        and afterwards of Antony, rose from the position of mule-driver to
        the command of a Roman army, and at last to the consulate,<a id=

        Augustus, though the most aristocratic of emperors, in order to
        discourage celibacy, permitted all citizens who were not senators to
        intermarry with freedwomen. The empire was in several distinct ways
        unfavourable to class distinctions. It was for the most part
        essentially democratic, winning its popularity from the masses of the
        people, and crushing the senate, which had been the common centre of
        aristocracy and of freedom. A new despotic power, bearing alike on
        all classes, reduced them to an equality of servitude. The emperors
        were themselves in many cases the mere creatures of revolt, and their
        policy was governed by their origin. Their jealousy struck
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg 233]</span><a name="Pg233"
        id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> down many of the nobles, while
        others were ruined by the public games, which it became customary to
        give, or by the luxury to which, in the absence of political
        occupations, they were impelled, and the relative importance of all
        was diminished by the new creations. The ascendancy of wealth began
        to pass into new quarters. Delators, or political informers,
        encouraged by the emperors, and enriched by the confiscated
        properties of those whose condemnation they had procured, rose to
        great influence. From the time of Caligula, for several reigns, the
        most influential citizens were freedmen, who occupied the principal
        offices in the palace, and usually obtained complete ascendancy over
        the emperors. Through them alone petitions were presented. By their
        instrumentality the Imperial favours were distributed. They sometimes
        dethroned the emperors. They retained their power unshaken through a
        succession of revolutions. In wealth, in power, in the crowd of their
        courtiers, in the splendour of their palaces in life, and of their
        tombs in death, they eclipsed all others, and men whom the early
        Roman patricians would have almost disdained to notice, saw the
        proudest struggling for their favour.<a id="noteref_360" name=
        "noteref_360" href="#note_360"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Together with
        these influences many others of a kindred nature may be detected. The
        colonial policy which the Gracchi had advocated was carried out at
        Narbonne, and during the latter days of Julius Cæsar, to the
        amazement and scandal of the Romans, Gauls of this province obtained
        seats in the senate.<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href=
        "#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a> The
        immense extent of the empire made it necessary for numerous troops to
        remain during long periods of time in distant provinces, and the
        foreign habits that were thus acquired began the destruction of the
        exclusive feelings of the Roman army, which the subsequent enrolment
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name=
        "Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> barbarians completed.
        The public games, the immense luxury, the concentration of power,
        wealth, and genius, made Rome the centre of a vast and ceaseless
        concourse of strangers, the focus of all the various philosophies and
        religions of the empire, and its population soon became an amorphous,
        heterogeneous mass, in which all nations, customs, languages, and
        creeds, all degrees of virtue and vice, of refinement and barbarism,
        of scepticism and credulity, intermingled and interacted. Travelling
        had become more easy and perhaps more frequent than it has been at
        any other period before the nineteenth century. The subjection of the
        whole civilised world to a single rule removed the chief obstacles to
        locomotion. Magnificent roads, which modern nations have rarely
        rivalled and never surpassed, intersected the entire empire, and
        relays of post-horses enabled the voyager to proceed with an
        astonishing rapidity. The sea, which, after the destruction of the
        fleets of Carthage, had fallen almost completely under the dominion
        of pirates, had been cleared by Pompey. The European shores of the
        Mediterranean and the port of Alexandria were thronged with vessels.
        Romans traversed the whole extent of the empire on political,
        military, or commercial errands, or in search of health, or
        knowledge, or pleasure.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href=

        entrancing beauties of Como and of Tempe, the luxurious manners of
        Baiæ and Corinth, the schools, commerce, climate, and temples of
        Alexandria, the soft winters of Sicily, the artistic wonders and
        historic recollections of Athens and the Nile, the great colonial
        interests of Gaul, attracted their thousands, while Roman luxury
        needed the products of the remotest lands, and the demand for animals
        for the amphitheatre spread Roman enterprise into the wildest
        deserts. In the capital, the toleration accorded to different creeds
        was such that the city soon became a miniature of the <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> world. Almost every variety of
        charlatanism and of belief displayed itself unchecked, and boasted
        its train of proselytes. Foreign ideas were in every form in the
        ascendant. Greece, which had presided over the intellectual
        development of Rome, acquired a new influence under the favouring
        policy of Hadrian, and Greek became the language of some of the later
        as it had been of the earliest writers. Egyptian religions and
        philosophies excited the wildest enthusiasm. As early as the reign of
        Augustus there were many thousands of Jewish residents at Rome,<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the slave world
        a corresponding revolution was taking place. The large proportion of
        physicians and sculptors who were slaves, the appearance of three or
        four distinguished authors in the slave class, the numerous literary
        slaves imported from Greece, and the splendid examples of courage,
        endurance, and devotion to their masters furnished by slaves during
        the civil wars, and during some of the worst periods of the Empire,
        were bridging the chasm between the servile and the free classes, and
        the same tendency was more powerfully stimulated by the vast numbers
        and overwhelming influence of the freedmen. The enormous scale and
        frequent <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg
        236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        fluctuations of the great Roman establishments, and the innumerable
        captives reduced to slavery after every war, rendered manumission
        both frequent and easy, and it was soon regarded as a normal result
        of faithful service. Many slaves bought their freedom out of the
        savings which their masters always permitted them to make. Others
        paid for it by their labour after their emancipation. Some masters
        emancipated their slaves in order to obtain their part in the
        distribution of corn, others to prevent the discovery of their own

        desirous of having their funerals attended by a long train of
        freedmen, very many simply as a reward for long service.<a id=

        freedman was still under what was termed the patronage of his former
        master; he was bound to him by what in a later age would have been
        called a feudal tie, and the political and social importance of a
        noble depended in a very great degree upon the multitude of his
        clients. The children of the emancipated slave were in the same
        relation to the patron, and it was only in the third generation that
        all disqualifications and restraints were abrogated. In consequence
        of this system, manumission was often the interest of the master. In
        the course of his life he enfranchised individual slaves. On his
        death-bed or by his will he constantly emancipated multitudes.
        Emancipation by testament acquired such dimensions, that Augustus
        found it necessary to restrict the power; and he made several
        limitations, of which the most important was that no one should
        emancipate by his will more than one hundred of his slaves.<a id=

        once proposed that the slaves should be distinguished by a special
        dress, but the proposition was abandoned because their number was so
        great that to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg

        among those who were not slaves, the element that was derived from
        slavery soon preponderated. The majority of the free population had
        probably either themselves been slaves, or were descended from
        slaves, and men with this tainted lineage penetrated to all the
        offices of the State.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest how
        profound a change had taken place since the Republican days, when the
        highest dignities were long monopolised by a single class, when the
        censors repressed with a stringent severity every form or exhibition
        of luxury, when the rhetoricians were banished from the city, lest
        the faintest tinge of foreign manners should impair the stern
        simplicity of the people, and when the proposal to transfer the
        capital to Veii, after a great disaster, was rejected on the ground
        that it would be impious to worship the Roman deities anywhere but on
        the Capitol, or for the Flamens and the Vestals to emigrate beyond
        the walls.<a id="noteref_371" name="noteref_371" href=
        "#note_371"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The greater number
        of these tendencies to universal fusion or equality were blind forces
        resulting from the stress of circumstances, and not from any human
        forethought, or were agencies that were put in motion for a different
        object. It must, however, be acknowledged that a definite theory of
        policy had a considerable part in accelerating the movement. The
        policy of the Republic may be broadly described as a policy of
        conquest, and that of the Empire as a policy of preservation. The
        Romans having acquired a vast dominion, were met by the great problem
        which every first-class power is called upon to solve—by what means
        many communities, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page238">[pg
        238]</span><a name="Pg238" id="Pg238" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        with different languages, customs, characters, and traditions, can be
        retained peaceably under a single ruler. In modern times, this
        difficulty has been most successfully met by local legislatures,
        which, if they supply a <span class="tei tei-q">“line of
        cleavage,”</span> a nucleus around which the spirit of opposition may
        form, have on the other hand the priceless advantage of giving the
        annexed people a large measure of self-government, a centre and
        safety-valve of local public opinion, a sphere for local ambitions,
        and a hierarchy of institutions adapted to the distinctive national
        type. Under no other conditions can a complex empire be carried on
        with so little strain, or effort, or humiliation, or its inevitable
        final dissolution be effected with so little danger or convulsion.
        But local legislatures, which are the especial glory of English
        statesmanship, belong exclusively to modern civilisation. The Roman
        method of conciliation was, first of all, the most ample toleration
        of the customs, religion, and municipal freedom of the conquered, and
        then their gradual admission to the privileges of the conqueror. By
        confiding to them in a great measure the defence of the empire, by
        throwing open to them the offices of State, and especially by
        according to them the right of Roman citizenship, which had been for
        centuries jealously restricted to the inhabitants of Rome, and was
        afterwards only conceded to Italy and Cisalpine Gaul, the emperors
        sought to attach them to their throne. The process was very gradual,
        but the whole movement of political emancipation attained its
        completion when the Imperial throne was occupied by the Spaniard
        Trajan, and by Pertinax, the son of a freedman, and when an edict of
        Caracalla extended the rights of Roman citizenship to all the
        provinces of the empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will appear
        evident, from the foregoing sketch, that the period which elapsed
        between Panætius and Constantine exhibited an irresistible tendency
        to cosmopolitanism. The convergence, when we consider the number,
        force, and harmony of the influences that composed it, is indeed
        unexampled <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page239">[pg
        239]</span><a name="Pg239" id="Pg239" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in
        history. The movement extended through all the fields of religious,
        philosophical, political, industrial, military, and domestic life.
        The character of the people was completely transformed, the landmarks
        of all its institutions were removed, the whole principle of its
        organisation was reversed. It would be impossible to find a more
        striking example of the manner in which events govern character,
        destroying old habits and associations, and thus altering that
        national type of excellence which is, for the most part, the
        expression or net moral result of the national institutions and
        circumstances. The effect of the movement was, no doubt, in many
        respects evil, and some of the best men, such as the elder Cato and
        Tacitus, opposed it, as leading to the demoralisation of the empire;
        but if it increased vice, it also gave a peculiar character to
        virtue. It was impossible that the conception of excellence, formed
        in a society where everything conspired to deepen class divisions and
        national jealousies and antipathies, should be retained unaltered in
        a period of universal intercourse and amalgamation. The moral
        expression of the first period is obviously to be found in the
        narrower military and patriotic virtues; that of the second period in
        enlarged philanthropy and sympathy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Stoical
        philosophy was admirably fitted to preside over this extension of
        sympathies. Although it proved itself in every age the chief school
        of patriots, it recognised also, from the very first, and in the most
        unequivocal manner, the fraternity of mankind. The Stoic taught that
        virtue alone is a good, and that all other things are indifferent;
        and from this position he inferred that birth, rank, country, or
        wealth are the mere accidents of life, and that virtue alone makes
        one man superior to another. He taught also that the Deity is an
        all-pervading Spirit, animating the universe, and revealed with
        especial clearness in the soul of man; and he concluded that all men
        are fellow-members of a single body, united by participation in the
        same Divine Spirit. These two doctrines <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> formed part of the very first teaching of the
        Stoics, but it was the special glory of the Roman teachers, and an
        obvious result of the condition of affairs I have described, to have
        brought them into full relief. One of the most emphatic as well as
        one of the earliest extant assertions of the duty of <span class=

        in the treatise of Cicero upon duties, which was avowedly based upon
        Stoicism. Writing at a period when the movement of amalgamation had
        for a generation been rapidly proceeding,<a id="noteref_373" name=
        "noteref_373" href="#note_373"><span class=

        adopting almost without restriction the ethics of the Stoics, Cicero
        maintained the doctrine of universal brotherhood as distinctly as it
        was afterwards maintained by the Christian Church. <span class=

        same principles were reiterated with increasing emphasis by the later
        Stoics. Adopting the well-known line which Terence had translated
        from Menander, they maintained that man should deem nothing human
        foreign to his interest. Lucan expatiated with all the fervour of a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far Stoicism
        appears fully equal to the moral requirements of the age. It would be
        impossible to recognise more cordially or to enforce more beautifully
        that doctrine of universal brotherhood for which the circumstances of
        the Roman Empire had made men ripe. Plato had said that no one is
        born for himself alone, but that he owes himself in part to his
        country, in part to his parents, and in part to his friends. The
        Roman Stoics, taking a wider survey, declared that man is born not
        for himself but for the whole world.<a id="noteref_385" name=
        "noteref_385" href="#note_385"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">385</span></span></a> And
        their doctrine was perfectly consistent with the original principles
        of their school.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while Stoicism
        was quite capable of representing the widening movement, it was not
        equally capable of representing the softening movement of
        civilisation. Its condemnation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the affections, and its stern, tense ideal,
        admirably fitted for the struggles of a simple military age, were
        unsuited for the mild manners and luxurious tastes of the age of the
        Antonines. A class of writers began to arise who, like the Stoics,
        believed virtue, rather than enjoyment, to be the supreme good, and
        who acknowledged that virtue consisted solely of the control which
        the enlightened will exercises over the desires, but who at the same
        time gave free scope to the benevolent affections and a more
        religious and mystical tone to the whole scheme of morals. Professing
        various speculative doctrines, and calling themselves by many
        names—eclectics, peripatetics, or Platonists—they agreed in forming
        or representing a moral character, less strong, less sublime, less
        capable of endurance and heroism, less conspicuous for energy of
        will, than that of the Stoics, but far more tender and attractive.
        The virtues of force began to recede, and the gentler virtues to
        advance, in the moral type. Insensibility to suffering was no longer
        professed; indomitable strength was no longer idolised, and it was
        felt that weakness and sorrow have their own appropriate
        virtues.<a id="noteref_386" name="noteref_386" href=
        "#note_386"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">386</span></span></a> The
        works of these writers are full of delicate touches which nothing but
        strong and lively feelings could have suggested. We find this in the
        well-known letter of Pliny on the death of his slaves,<a id=
        "noteref_387" name="noteref_387" href="#note_387"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">387</span></span></a> in the
        frequent protests against the ostentation of indifference with which
        the Stoics regarded the loss of their friends, in many instances of
        simple, artless pathos, which strike the finest chords of our nature.
        When Plutarch, after the death of his daughter, was writing a letter
        of consolation to his wife, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page243">[pg
        243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> we
        find him turning away from all the commonplaces of the Stoics as the
        recollection of one simple trait of his little child rushed upon his
        mind:—<span class="tei tei-q">“She desired her nurse to press even
        her dolls to the breast. She was so loving that she wished everything
        that gave her pleasure to share in the best of what she
        had.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Plutarch, whose
        fame as a biographer has, I think, unduly eclipsed his reputation as
        a moralist, may be justly regarded as the leader of this movement,
        and his moral writings may be profitably compared with those of
        Seneca, the most ample exponent of the sterner school. Seneca is not
        unfrequently self-conscious, theatrical, and overstrained. His
        precepts have something of the affected ring of a popular preacher.
        The imperfect fusion of his short sentences gives his style a
        disjointed and, so to speak, granulated character, which the Emperor
        Caligula happily expressed when he compared it to sand without
        cement; yet he often rises to a majesty of eloquence, a grandeur both
        of thought and of expression, that few moralists have ever rivalled.
        Plutarch, though far less sublime, is more sustained, equable, and
        uniformly pleasing. The Montaigne of antiquity, his genius coruscates
        playfully and gracefully around his subject; he delights in
        illustrations which are often singularly vivid and original, but
        which, by their excessive multiplication, appear sometimes rather the
        texture than the ornament of his discourse. A gentle, tender spirit,
        and a judgment equally free from paradox, exaggeration, and excessive
        subtilty, are the characteristics of all he wrote. Plutarch excels
        most in collecting motives of consolation; Seneca in forming
        characters that need no consolation. There is something of the woman
        in Plutarch; Seneca is all a man. The writings of the first resemble
        the strains of the flute, to which the ancients attributed the power
        of calming the passions and charming away the clouds of sorrow, and
        drawing men by a gentle suasion into the paths of virtue; the
        writings of the other are like the trumpet-blast, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which kindles the soul with an heroic
        courage. The first is most fitted to console a mother sorrowing over
        her dead child, the second to nerve a brave man, without flinching
        and without illusion, to grapple with an inevitable fate.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The elaborate
        letters which Seneca has left us on distinctive tenets of the Stoical
        school, such as the equality of vices or the evil of the affections,
        have now little more than an historic interest; but the general tone
        of his writings gives them a permanent importance, for they reflect
        and foster a certain type of excellence which, since the extinction
        of Stoicism, has had no adequate expression in literature. The
        prevailing moral tone of Plutarch, on the other hand, being formed
        mainly on the prominence of the amiable virtues, has been eclipsed or
        transcended by the Christian writers, but his definite contributions
        to philosophy and morals are more important than those of Seneca. He
        has left us one of the best works on superstition, and one of the
        most ingenious works on Providence, we possess. He was probably the
        first writer who advocated very strongly humanity to animals on the
        broad ground of universal benevolence, as distinguished from the
        Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration, and he was also remarkable,
        beyond all his contemporaries, for his high sense of female
        excellence and of the sanctity of female love.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Romans had at
        all times cared more for the practical tendency of a system of
        philosophy than for its logical or speculative consistency. One of
        the chief attractions of Stoicism, in their eyes, had been that its
        main object was not to build a system of opinion, but to propose a
        pattern of life,<a id="noteref_388" name="noteref_388" href=
        "#note_388"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">388</span></span></a> and
        Stoicism itself was only adapted to the Roman character after it had
        been simplified by Panætius.<a id="noteref_389" name="noteref_389"
        href="#note_389"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">389</span></span></a>
        Although the system could never free itself altogether from that
        hardness which rendered it so unsuited for an advanced civilisation,
        it <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page245">[pg 245]</span><a name=
        "Pg245" id="Pg245" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was profoundly
        modified by the later Stoics, who rarely scrupled to temper it by the
        admixture of new doctrines. Seneca himself was by no means an unmixed
        Stoic. If Epictetus was more nearly so, this was probably because the
        extreme hardship he underwent made him dwell more than his
        contemporaries upon the importance of fortitude and endurance. Marcus
        Aurelius was surrounded by the disciples of the most various schools,
        and his Stoicism was much tinctured by the milder and more religious
        spirit of Platonism. The Stoics, like all other men, felt the moral
        current of the time, though they yielded to it less readily than some
        others. In Thrasea, who occupied in his age a position analogous to
        that of Cato in an earlier period, we find little or nothing of the
        asperity and hardness of his great prototype. In the writings of the
        later Stoics, if we find the same elements as in those of their
        predecessors, these elements are at least combined in different
        proportions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the first
        place, Stoicism became more essentially religious. The Stoical
        character, like all others of a high order, had always been
        reverential; but its reverence differed widely from that of
        Christians. It was concentrated much less upon the Deity than upon
        virtue, and especially upon virtue as exhibited in great men. When
        Lucan, extolling his hero, boasted that <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        gods favoured the conquering cause, but Cato the conquered,”</span>
        or when Seneca described <span class="tei tei-q">“the fortune of
        Sulla”</span> as <span class="tei tei-q">“the crime of the
        gods,”</span> these sentences, which sound to modern ears grossly
        blasphemous, appear to have excited no murmur. We have already seen
        the audacious language with which the sage claimed an equality with
        the Divinity. On the other hand, the reverence for virtue apart from
        all conditions of success, and especially for men of the stamp of
        Cato, who through a strong moral conviction struggled bravely, though
        unsuccessfully, against force, genius, or circumstances, was perhaps
        more steady and more passionate than in any later age. The duty of
        absolute <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg
        246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        submission to Providence, as I have already shown, was continually
        inculcated, and the pantheistic notion of all virtue being a part or
        emanation of the Deity was often asserted, but man was still the
        centre of the Stoic's scheme, the ideal to which his reverence and
        devotion aspired. In later Stoicism this point of view was gradually
        changed. Without any formal abandonment of their pantheistic
        conceptions, the language of philosophers recognised with much
        greater clearness a distinct and personal Divinity. Every page of
        Epictetus and Marcus Aurelius is impregnated with the deepest
        religious feeling. <span class="tei tei-q">“The first thing to
        learn,”</span> said the former, <span class="tei tei-q">“is that
        there is a God, that His knowledge pervades the whole universe, and
        that it extends not only to our acts but to our thoughts and
        feelings.... He who seeks to please the gods must labour as far as
        lies in him to resemble them. He must be faithful as God is faithful,
        free as He is free, beneficent as He is beneficent, magnanimous as He
        is magnanimous.”</span><a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“To have God for our maker and father and

        praise God, and I fulfil it; nor shall I ever, as far as lies in me,
        shrink from my task, and I exhort you to join in the same song of
        praise.”</span><a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The same religious
        character is exhibited, if possible, in a still greater degree in the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Meditations”</span> of Marcus Aurelius; but
        in one respect the ethics of the emperor differ <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg 247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> widely from those of the slave. In
        Epictetus we invariably find the strongest sense of the majesty of
        man. As the child of the Deity, as a being capable of attaining the
        most exalted virtue, he magnified him to the highest point, and never
        more so than in the very passage in which he exhorted his disciples
        to beware of haughtiness. The Jupiter Olympus of Phidias, he reminds
        them, exhibits no arrogance, but the unclouded serenity of perfect
        confidence and strength.<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href=
        "#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a> Marcus
        Aurelius, on the other hand, dwelt rather on the weakness than on the
        force of man, and his meditations breathe a spirit, if not of
        Christian humility, at least of the gentlest and most touching
        modesty. He was not, it is true, like some later saints, who
        habitually apply to themselves language of reprobation which would be
        exaggerated if applied to the murderer or the adulterer. He did not
        shrink from recognising human virtue as a reality, and thanking
        Providence for the degree in which he had attained it, but he
        continually reviewed with an unsparing severity the weaknesses of his
        character, he accepted and even solicited reproofs from every teacher
        of virtue, he made it his aim, in a position of supreme power, to
        check every emotion of arrogance and pride, and he set before him an
        ideal of excellence which awed and subdued his mind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another very
        remarkable feature of later Stoicism was its increasingly
        introspective character. In the philosophy of Cato and Cicero, virtue
        was displayed almost exclusively in action. In the later Stoics,
        self-examination and purity of thought were continually inculcated.
        There are some writers who, with an obstinacy which it is more easy
        to explain than to excuse, persist, in defiance of the very clearest
        evidence to the contrary, in representing these virtues as
        exclusively Christian, and in maintaining, without a shadow of proof,
        that the place they undeniably occupy in the later <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248" id="Pg248"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Roman moralists was due to the direct or
        indirect influence of the new faith. The plain fact is that they were
        fully known to the Greeks, and both Plato and Zeno even exhorted men
        to study their dreams, on the ground that these often reveal the
        latent tendencies of the disposition.<a id="noteref_395" name=

        Pythagoras urged his disciples daily to examine themselves when they

        "#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Sextius, one of the masters of Seneca, a philosopher of the school of
        Pythagoras, who flourished chiefly before the Christian era, was
        accustomed daily to devote a portion of time to self-examination; and
        Seneca, who at first inclined much to the tenets of Pythagoras,<a id=
        "noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        expressly tells us that it was from Sextius he learnt the
        practice.<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href=
        "#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> The
        increasing prominence of the Pythagorean philosophy which accompanied
        the invasion of Oriental creeds, the natural tendency of the empire,
        by closing the avenues of political life, to divert the attention
        from action to emotion, and also the increased latitude allowed to
        the play of the sympathies or affections by the later Stoics, brought
        this emotional part of virtue into great prominence. The letters of
        Seneca are a kind of moral medicine applied for the most part to the
        cure of different <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg
        249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        infirmities of character. Plutarch, in a beautiful treatise on
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The Signs of Moral Progress,”</span> treated
        the culture of the feelings with delicate skill. The duty of serving
        the Divinity with a pure mind rather than by formal rites became a
        commonplace of literature, and self-examination one of the most
        recognised of duties. Epictetus urged men so to purify their
        imaginations, that at the sight of a beautiful woman they should not
        even mentally exclaim, <span class="tei tei-q">“Happy her
        husband!”</span><a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href=
        "#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a> The
        meditations of Marcus Aurelius, above all, are throughout an exercise
        of self-examination, and the duty of watching over the thoughts is
        continually inculcated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a saying of
        Plutarch that Stoicism, which sometimes exercised a prejudicial and
        hardening influence upon characters that were by nature stern and
        unbending, proved peculiarly useful as a cordial to those which were
        naturally gentle and yielding. Of this truth we can have no better
        illustration than is furnished by the life and writings of Marcus
        Aurelius, the last and most perfect representative of Roman Stoicism.
        A simple, childlike, and eminently affectionate disposition, with
        little strength of intellect or perhaps originally of will, much more
        inclined to meditation, speculation, solitude, or friendship, than to
        active and public life, with a profound aversion to the pomp of
        royalty and with a rather strong natural leaning to pedantry, he had
        embraced the fortifying philosophy of Zeno in its best form, and that
        philosophy made him perhaps as nearly a perfectly virtuous man as has
        ever appeared upon our world. Tried by the chequered events of a
        reign of nineteen years, presiding over a society that was profoundly
        corrupt, and over a city that was notorious for its license, the
        perfection of his character awed even calumny to silence, and the
        spontaneous sentiment of his people proclaimed him rather a god than
        a man.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href=
        "#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> inner life we can speak so confidently. His
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Meditations,”</span> which form one of the
        most impressive, form also one of the truest books in the whole range
        of religious literature. They consist of rude fragmentary notes
        without literary skill or arrangement, written for the most part in
        hasty, broken, and sometimes almost unintelligible sentences amid the
        turmoil of a camp,<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href=
        "#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a> and
        recording, in accents of the most penetrating sincerity, the
        struggles, doubts, and aims of a soul of which, to employ one of his
        own images, it may be truly said that it possessed the purity of a
        star, which needs no veil to hide its nakedness. The undisputed
        master of the whole civilised world, he set before him as models such
        men as Thrasea and Helvidius, as Cato and Brutus, and he made it his
        aim to realise the conception of a free State in which all citizens
        are equal, and of a royalty which makes it its first duty to respect
        the liberty of the citizens.<a id="noteref_405" name="noteref_405"
        href="#note_405"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">405</span></span></a> His
        life was passed in unremitting activity. For nearly twelve years he
        was absent with armies in the distant provinces of the empire; and
        although his political capacity has been much and perhaps justly
        questioned, it is impossible to deny the unwearied zeal with which he
        discharged the duties of his great position. Yet few men have ever
        carried farther the virtue of little things, the delicate moral tact
        and the minute scruples which, though often exhibited by women and by
        secluded religionists, very rarely survive much contact with active
        life. The solicitude with which he endeavoured to persuade two
        jealous rhetoricians to abstain during their debates from retorts
        that might destroy their friendship,<a id="noteref_406" name=

        all, I think, inexpressibly touching when we remember that they were
        exhibited by one who was the supreme ruler of the civilised globe,
        and who was continually engaged in the direction of the most gigantic
        interests. But that which is especially remarkable in Marcus Aurelius
        is the complete absence of fanaticism in his philanthropy. Despotic
        monarchs sincerely anxious to improve mankind are naturally led to
        endeavour, by acts of legislation, to force society into the paths
        which they believe to be good, and such men, acting under such
        motives, have sometimes been the scourges of mankind. Philip II. and
        Isabella the Catholic inflicted more suffering in obedience to their
        consciences than Nero and Domitian in obedience to their lusts. But
        Marcus Aurelius steadily resisted the temptation. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Never hope,”</span> he once wrote, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to realise Plato's Republic. Let it be sufficient that
        you have in some slight degree ameliorated mankind, and do not think
        that amelioration a matter of small importance. Who can change the

        but reluctant slaves and hypocrites?”</span><a id="noteref_412" name=

        promulgated many laws inspired by a spirit of the purest benevolence.
        He <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name=
        "Pg252" id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mitigated the
        gladiatorial shows. He treated with invariable deference the senate,
        which was the last bulwark of political freedom. He endowed many
        chairs of philosophy which were intended to diffuse knowledge and
        moral teaching through the people. He endeavoured by the example of
        his Court to correct the extravagances of luxury that were prevalent,
        and he exhibited in his own career a perfect model of an active and
        conscientious administrator; but he made no rash efforts to force the
        people by stringent laws out of the natural channel of their lives.
        Of the corruption of his subjects he was keenly sensible, and he bore
        it with a mournful but gentle patience. We may trace in this respect
        the milder spirit of those Greek teachers who had diverged from
        Stoicism, but it was especially from the Stoical doctrine that all
        vice springs from ignorance that he derived his rule of life, and
        this doctrine, to which he repeatedly recurred, imparted to all his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The character of
        the virtue of Marcus Aurelius, though exhibiting the softening
        influence of the Greek spirit which in his time pervaded the empire,
        was in its essentials strictly Roman.<a id="noteref_420" name=

        full of reverential gratitude to Providence, we do not find in him
        that intense humility and that deep and subtle religious feeling
        which were the principles of Hebrew virtue, and which have given the
        Jewish writers so great an ascendancy over the hearts of men. Though
        borne naturally and instinctively to goodness, his <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Meditations”</span> do not display the keen æsthetical
        sense of the beauty of virtue which was the leading motive of Greek
        morals, and which the writing of Plotinus afterwards made very
        familiar to the Roman world. Like most of the best Romans, the
        principle of his virtue was the sense of duty, the conviction of the
        existence of a law of nature to which it is the aim and purpose of
        our being to conform. Of secondary motives he appears to have been
        little sensible. The belief in a superintending Providence was the
        strongest of his religious convictions, but even that was
        occasionally overcast. On the subject of a future world his mind
        floated in a desponding doubt. The desire for posthumous fame he
        deemed it his duty systematically to mortify. While most writers of
        his school regarded death chiefly as the end of sorrows, and dwelt
        upon it in order to dispel its terrors, in Marcus Aurelius it is
        chiefly represented as the last great demonstration of the vanity of
        earthly things. Seldom, indeed, has such active and unrelaxing virtue
        been united with so little enthusiasm, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class=

        success. <span class="tei tei-q">“There is but one thing,”</span> he
        wrote, <span class="tei tei-q">“of real value—to cultivate truth and

        however, who have before us the records of his inner life, can have
        no difficulty in detecting the deep melancholy that overshadowed his
        mind, and his closing years were darkened by many and various
        sorrows. His wife, whom he dearly loved and deeply honoured, and who,
        if we may believe the Court scandals that are reported by historians,
        was not worthy of his affection,<a id="noteref_423" name=

        preceded him to the tomb. His only surviving son had already
        displayed the vicious tendencies that afterwards made him one of the
        worst of rulers. The philosophers, who had instructed him in his
        youth, and to whom he had clung with an affectionate friendship, had
        one by one disappeared, and no new race had arisen to supply their
        place. After a long reign of self-denying virtue, he saw the
        decadence of the empire continually more apparent. The Stoical school
        was rapidly fading before the passion for Oriental superstitions. The
        barbarians, repelled for a time, were again menacing the frontiers,
        and it was not difficult to foresee their future triumph. The mass of
        the people had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg
        255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        become too inert and too corrupt for any efforts to regenerate them.
        A fearful pestilence, followed by many minor calamities, had fallen
        upon the land and spread misery and panic through many provinces. In
        the midst of these calamities, the emperor was struck down with a
        mortal illness, which he bore with the placid courage he had always
        displayed, exhibiting in almost the last words he uttered his
        forgetfulness of self and his constant anxiety for the condition of
        his people.<a id="noteref_424" name="noteref_424" href=
        "#note_424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        before his death he dismissed his attendants, and, after one last

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus sank to rest
        in clouds and darkness the purest and gentlest spirit of all the
        pagan world, the most perfect model of the later Stoics. In him the
        hardness, asperity, and arrogance of the sect had altogether
        disappeared, while the affectation its paradoxes tended to produce
        was greatly mitigated. Without fanaticism, superstition, or illusion,
        his whole life was regulated by a simple and unwavering sense of
        duty. The contemplative and emotional virtues which Stoicism had long
        depressed, had regained their place, but the active virtues had not
        yet declined. The virtues of the hero were still deeply honoured, but
        gentleness and tenderness had acquired a new prominence in the ideal
        type.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But while the
        force of circumstances was thus developing the ethical conceptions of
        antiquity in new directions, the mass of the Roman people were
        plunged in a condition of depravity which no mere ethical teaching
        could adequately correct. The moral condition of the empire is,
        indeed, in some respects one of the most appalling pictures on
        record, and writers have much more frequently undertaken to paint or
        even to exaggerate its enormity than to investigate the circumstances
        by which it may be explained. Such circumstances, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> however, must unquestionably exist. There
        is no reason to believe that the innate propensities of the people
        were worse during the Empire than during the best days of the
        Republic. The depravity of a nation is a phenomenon which, like all
        others, may be traced to definite causes, and in the instance before
        us they are not difficult to discover.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
        said that the virtue of the Romans was a military and patriotic
        virtue, formed by the national institutions, and to which religious
        teaching was merely accessory. The domestic, military, and censorial
        discipline, concurring with the general poverty and also with the
        agricultural pursuits of the people, had created the simplest and
        most austere habits, while the institutions of civic liberty provided
        ample spheres for honourable ambition. The nobles, being the highest
        body in a free State, and being at the same time continually
        confronted by a formidable opposition under the guidance of the
        tribunes, were ardently devoted to public life. The dangerous rivalry
        of the surrounding Italian States, and afterwards of Carthage,
        demanded and secured a constant vigilance. Roman education was
        skilfully designed to elicit heroic patriotism, and the great men of
        the past became the ideal figures of the imagination. Religion
        hallowed the local feeling by rites and legends, instituted many
        useful and domestic habits, taught men the sanctity of oaths, and, by
        fostering a continual sense of a superintending Providence, gave a
        depth and solemnity to the whole character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
        chief influences by which the national type of virtue had been
        formed, but nearly all of these were corroded or perverted by
        advancing civilisation. The domestic and local religion lost its
        ascendancy amid the increase of scepticism and the invasion of a
        crowd of foreign superstitions. The simplicity of manners, which
        sumptuary laws and the institution of the censorship had long
        maintained, was replaced by the extravagances of a Babylonian luxury.
        The aristocratic <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
        257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        dignity perished with the privileges on which it reposed. The
        patriotic energy and enthusiasm died away in a universal empire which
        embraced all varieties of language, custom, and nationality.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although the
        virtues of a poor and struggling community necessarily disappear
        before increasing luxury, they are in a normal condition of society
        replaced by virtues of a different stamp. Gentler manners and
        enlarged benevolence follow in the train of civilisation, greater
        intellectual activity and more extended industrial enterprise give a
        new importance to the moral qualities which each of these require,
        the circle of political interests expands, and if the virtues that
        spring from privilege diminish, the virtues that spring from equality
        increase.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Rome, however,
        there were three great causes which impeded the normal
        development—the Imperial system, the institution of slavery, and the
        gladiatorial shows. Each of these exercised an influence of the
        widest and most pernicious character on the morals of the people. To
        trace those influences in all their ramifications would lead me far
        beyond the limits I have assigned to the present work, but I shall
        endeavour to give a concise view of their nature and general
        character.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theory of the
        Roman Empire was that of a representative despotism. The various
        offices of the Republic were not annihilated, but they were gradually
        concentrated in a single man. The senate was still ostensibly the
        depository of supreme power, but it was made in fact the mere
        creature of the Emperor, whose power was virtually uncontrolled.
        Political spies and private accusers, who in the latter days of the
        Republic had been encouraged to denounce plots against the State,
        began under Augustus to denounce plots against the Emperor; and the
        class being enormously increased under Tiberius, and stimulated by
        the promise of part of the confiscated property, they menaced every
        leading politician and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg
        258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        even every wealthy man. The nobles were gradually depressed, ruined,
        or driven by the dangers of public life into orgies of private
        luxury. The poor were conciliated, not by any increase of liberty or
        even of permanent prosperity, but by gratuitous distributions of corn
        and by public games, while, in order to invest themselves with a
        sacred character, the emperors adopted the religious device of an
        apotheosis.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last
        superstition, of which some traces may still be found in the titles
        appropriated to royalty, was not wholly a suggestion of politicians.
        Deified men had long occupied a prominent place in ancient belief,
        and the founders of cities had been very frequently worshipped by the
        inhabitants.<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href=
        "#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a>
        Although to more educated minds the ascription of divinity to a
        sovereign was simply an unmeaning flattery, although it in no degree
        prevented either innumerable plots against his life, or an unsparing
        criticism of his memory, yet the popular reverence not unfrequently
        anticipated politicians in representing the emperor as in some
        special way under the protection of Providence. Around Augustus a
        whole constellation of miraculous stories soon clustered. An oracle,
        it was said, had declared his native city destined to produce a ruler
        of the world. When a child, he had been borne by invisible hands from
        his cradle, and placed on a lofty tower, where he was found with his
        face turned to the rising sun. He rebuked the frogs that croaked
        around his grandfather's home, and they became silent for ever. An
        eagle snatched a piece of bread from his hand, soared into the air,
        and then, descending, presented it to him again. Another eagle
        dropped at his feet a chicken, bearing a laurel-branch in its beak.
        When his body was burnt, his image was seen rising to heaven above
        the flames. When another man tried to sleep in the bed in which the
        Emperor had been born, the profane intruder was <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259" id="Pg259"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> dragged forth by an unseen hand. A
        patrician named Lætorius, having been condemned for adultery, pleaded
        in mitigation of the sentence that he was the happy possessor of the
        spot of ground on which Augustus was born.<a id="noteref_427" name=

        Asiatic town, named Cyzicus, was deprived of its freedom by Tiberius,
        chiefly because it had neglected the worship of Augustus.<a id=

        emperor was surrounded by a supernatural aureole. Every usurpation,
        every break in the ordinary line of succession, was adumbrated by a
        series of miracles; and signs, both in heaven and earth, were
        manifested whenever an emperor was about to die.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the emperors
        themselves, a great majority, no doubt, accepted their divine honours
        as an empty pageant, and more than one exhibited beneath the purple a
        simplicity of tastes and character which the boasted heroes of the
        Republic had never surpassed. It is related of Vespasian that, when
        dying, he jested mournfully on his approaching dignity, observing, as
        he felt his strength ebbing away, <span class="tei tei-q">“I think I

        Alexander Severus and Julian refused to accept the ordinary language
        of adulation, and of those who did not reject it we know that many
        looked upon it as a modern sovereign looks upon the phraseology of
        petitions or the ceremonies of the Court. Even Nero was so far from
        being intoxicated with his Imperial dignity that he continually
        sought triumphs as a singer or an actor, and it was his artistic
        skill, not his divine prerogatives, that excited his vanity.<a id=

        Heliogabalus, if we may give any credence to his biographer,
        confounded all things, human and divine, in hideous and blasphemous

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious
        consequence of this apotheosis was that the images of the emperors
        were invested with a sacred character like those of the gods. They
        were the recognised refuge of the slave or the oppressed,<a id=

        smallest disrespect to them was resented as a heinous crime. Under
        Tiberius, slaves and criminals were accustomed to hold in their hands
        an image of the emperor, and, being thus protected, to pour with

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may easily be
        conceived that men who had been raised to this pinnacle of arrogance
        and power, men who exercised uncontrolled authority in the midst of a
        society in a state of profound corruption, were often guilty of the
        most atrocious extravagances. In the first period of the Empire more
        especially, when traditions were not yet formed, and when experience
        had not yet shown the dangers of the throne, the brains of some of
        its occupants reeled at their elevation, and a kind of moral insanity
        ensued. The pages of Suetonius remain as an eternal witness of the
        abysses of depravity, the hideous, intolerable cruelty, the hitherto
        unimagined extravagances of nameless lust that were then manifested
        on the Palatine, and while they cast a fearful light upon the moral
        chaos into which pagan society had sunk, they furnish ample evidence
        of the demoralising influences of the empire. The throne was, it is
        true, occupied by some of the best as well as by some of the worst
        men who have ever lived; but the evil, though checked and mitigated,
        was never abolished. The corruption of a Court, the formation of a
        profession of spies, the encouragement given to luxury, the
        distributions of corn, and the multiplication of games, were evils
        which varied greatly in their degrees of intensity, but the very
        existence of the empire prevented the creation of those habits of
        political life which formed the moral type of the great republics of
        antiquity. Liberty, which is often very unfavourable to theological
        systems, is almost always in the end favourable to morals; for the
        most effectual method that has been devised for diverting men from
        vice is to give free scope to a higher ambition. This scope was
        absolutely wanting in the Roman Empire, and the moral condition, in
        the absence of lasting political habits, fluctuated greatly with the
        character of the Emperors.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The results of the
        institution of slavery were probably even more serious. In addition
        to its manifest effect in encouraging a tyrannical and ferocious
        spirit in the masters, it cast a stigma upon all labour, and at once
        degraded and impoverished the free poor. In modern societies the
        formation of an influential and numerous middle class, trained in the
        sober and regular habits of industrial life, is the chief guarantee
        of national morality, and where such a class exists, the disorders of
        the upper ranks, though undoubtedly injurious, are never fatal to
        society. The influence of great outbursts of fashionable depravity,
        such as that which followed the Restoration in England, is rarely
        more than superficial. The aristocracy may revel in every excess of
        ostentatious vice, but the great mass of the people, at the loom, the
        counter, or the plough, continue unaffected by their example, and the
        habits of life into which they are forced by the condition of their
        trades preserve them from gross depravity. It was the most frightful
        feature of the corruption of ancient Rome that it extended through
        every class of the community. In the absence of all but the simplest
        machinery, manufactures, with the vast industrial life they beget,
        were unknown. The poor citizen found almost all the spheres in which
        an honourable livelihood might be obtained wholly or at least in a
        very great degree preoccupied by slaves, while he had learnt to
        regard trade with an invincible repugnance. Hence followed the
        immense increase of corrupt and corrupting professions, as actors,
        pantomimes, hired gladiators, political spies, ministers to passion,
        astrologers, religious charlatans, pseudo-philosophers, which gave
        the free classes a precarious and occasional subsistence, and hence,
        too, the gigantic dimensions of the system of clientage. Every rich
        man was surrounded by a train of dependants, who lived in a great
        measure at his expense, and spent their lives in ministering to his
        passions and flattering his vanity. And, above all, the public
        distribution of corn, and occasionally of money, was carried on to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263"
        id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> such an extent, that, so far
        as the first necessaries of life were concerned, the whole poor free
        population of Rome was supported gratuitously by the Government. To
        effect this distribution promptly and lavishly was the main object of
        the Imperial policy, and its consequences were worse than could have
        resulted from the most extravagant poor-laws or the most excessive
        charity. The mass of the people were supported in absolute idleness
        by corn, which was given without any reference to desert, and was
        received, not as a favour, but as a right, while gratuitous public
        amusements still further diverted them from labour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under these
        influences the population rapidly dwindled away. Productive
        enterprise was almost extinct in Italy, and an unexampled concurrence
        of causes made a vicious celibacy the habitual condition. Already in
        the days of Augustus the evil was apparent, and the dangers which in
        later reigns drove the patricians still more generally from public
        life, drove them more and more into every extravagance of sensuality.
        Greece, since the destruction of her liberty, and also the leading
        cities of Asia Minor and of Egypt, had become centres of the wildest
        corruption, and Greek and Oriental captives were innumerable in Rome.
        Ionian slaves of a surpassing beauty, Alexandrian slaves, famous for
        their subtle skill in stimulating the jaded senses of the confirmed
        and sated libertine, became the ornaments of every patrician house,
        the companions and the instructors of the young. The disinclination
        to marriage was so general, that men who spent their lives in
        endeavouring by flatteries to secure the inheritance of wealthy
        bachelors became a numerous and a notorious class. The slave
        population was itself a hotbed of vice, and it contaminated all with
        which it came in contact; while the attractions of the games, and
        especially of the public baths, which became the habitual resort of
        the idle, combined with the charms of the Italian climate, and with
        the miserable domestic architecture that was general, to draw the
        poor <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name=
        "Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> citizens from indoor
        life. Idleness, amusements, and a bare subsistence were alone
        desired, and the general practice of abortion among the rich, and of
        infanticide and exposition in all classes, still further checked the
        population.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The destruction of
        all public spirit in a population so situated was complete and
        inevitable. In the days of the Republic a consul had once advocated
        the admission of a brave Italian people to the right of Roman
        citizenship, on the ground that <span class="tei tei-q">“those who
        thought only of liberty deserved to be Romans.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_442" name="noteref_442" href="#note_442"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">442</span></span></a> In the
        Empire all liberty was cheerfully bartered for games and corn, and
        the worst tyrant could by these means be secure of popularity. In the
        Republic, when Marius threw open the houses of those he had
        proscribed, to be plundered, the people, by a noble abstinence,
        rebuked the act, for no Roman could be found to avail himself of the
        permission.<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href=
        "#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a> In the
        Empire, when the armies of Vitellius and Vespasian were disputing the
        possession of the city, the degenerate Romans gathered with delight
        to the spectacle as to a gladiatorial show, plundered the deserted
        houses, encouraged either army by their reckless plaudits, dragged
        out the fugitives to be slain, and converted into a festival the
        calamity of their country.<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444"
        href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> The
        degradation of the national character was permanent. Neither the
        teaching of the Stoics, nor the government of the Antonines, nor the
        triumph of Christianity could restore it. Indifferent to liberty, the
        Roman now, as then, asks only for an idle subsistence and for public
        spectacles, and countless monasteries and ecclesiastical pageants
        occupy in modern Rome the same place as did the distributions of corn
        and the games of the amphitheatre in the Rome of the Cæsars.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must be
        remembered, too, that while public spirit had <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name="Pg265" id="Pg265"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thus decayed in the capital of the
        empire, there existed no independent or rival power to reanimate by
        its example the smouldering flame. The existence in modern Europe of
        many distinct nations on the same level of civilisation, but with
        different forms of government and conditions of national life,
        secures the permanence of some measure of patriotism and liberty. If
        these perish in one nation, they survive in another, and each people
        affects those about it by its rivalry or example. But an empire which
        comprised all the civilised globe could know nothing of this
        political interaction. In religious, social, intellectual, and moral
        life, foreign ideas were very discernible, but the enslaved provinces
        could have no influence in rekindling political life in the centre,
        and those which rivalled Italy in their civilisation, even surpassed
        it in their corruption and their servility.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In reviewing,
        however, the conditions upon which the moral state of the empire
        depended, there are still two very important centres or seed-plots of
        virtue to which it is necessary to advert. I mean the pursuit of
        agriculture and the discipline of the army. A very early tradition,
        which was attributed to Romulus, had declared that warfare and
        agriculture were the only honourable occupations for a citizen,<a id=
        "noteref_445" name="noteref_445" href="#note_445"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">445</span></span></a> and it
        would be difficult to overrate the influence of the last in forming
        temperate and virtuous habits among the people. It is the subject of
        the only extant work of the elder Cato. Virgil had adorned it with
        the lustre of his poetry. A very large part of the Roman religion was
        intended to symbolise its stages or consecrate its operations. Varro
        expressed an eminently Roman sentiment in that beautiful sentence
        which Cowper has introduced into English poetry, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Divine Providence made the country, but human art the
        town.”</span><a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href=
        "#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a> The
        reforms of Vespasian consisted chiefly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of the elevation to high positions of the
        agriculturists of the provinces. Antoninus, who was probably the most
        perfect of all the Roman emperors, was through his whole reign a
        zealous farmer.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As far as the
        distant provinces were concerned, it is probable that the Imperial
        system was on the whole a good. The scandalous rapacity of the
        provincial governors, which disgraced the closing years of the
        Republic, and which is immortalised by the indignant eloquence of
        Cicero, appears to have ceased, or at least greatly diminished, under
        the supervision of the emperors. Ample municipal freedom, good roads,
        and for the most part wise and temperate rulers, secured for the
        distant sections of the empire a large measure of prosperity. But in
        Italy itself, agriculture, with the habits of life that attended it,
        speedily and fatally decayed. The peasant proprietor soon glided
        hopelessly into debt. The immense advantages which slavery gave the
        rich gradually threw nearly all the Italian soil into their hands.
        The peasant who ceased to be proprietor found himself excluded by
        slave labour from the position of a hired cultivator, while the
        gratuitous distributions of corn drew him readily to the metropolis.
        The gigantic scale of these distributions induced the rulers to
        obtain their corn in the form of a tribute from distant countries,
        chiefly from Africa and Sicily, and it almost ceased to be cultivated
        in Italy. The land fell to waste, or was cultivated by slaves or
        converted into pasture, and over vast tracts the race of free
        peasants entirely disappeared.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This great
        revolution, which profoundly affected the moral condition of Italy,
        had long been impending. The debts of the poor peasants, and the
        tendency of the patricians to monopolise the conquered territory, had
        occasioned some of the fiercest contests of the Republic, and in the
        earliest days of the Empire the blight that seemed to have fallen on
        the Italian soil was continually and pathetically lamented. Livy,
        Varro, Columella, and Pliny have noticed it in the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> most emphatic terms,<a id="noteref_447"
        name="noteref_447" href="#note_447"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">447</span></span></a> and
        Tacitus observed that as early as the reign of Claudius, Italy, which
        had once supplied the distant provinces with corn, had become
        dependent for the very necessaries of life upon the winds and the
        waves.<a id="noteref_448" name="noteref_448" href=
        "#note_448"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">448</span></span></a> The
        evil was indeed of an almost hopeless kind. Adverse winds, or any
        other accidental interruption of the convoys of corn, occasioned
        severe distress in the capital; but the prospect of the calamities
        that would ensue if any misfortune detached the great corn-growing
        countries from the empire, might well have appalled the politician.
        Yet the combined influence of slavery, and of the gratuitous
        distributions of corn, acting in the manner I have described,
        rendered every effort to revive Italian agriculture abortive, and
        slavery had taken such deep root that it would have been impossible
        to abolish it, while no emperor dared to encounter the calamities and
        rebellion that would follow a suspension or even a restriction of the
        distributions.<a id="noteref_449" name="noteref_449" href=
        "#note_449"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">449</span></span></a> Many
        serious efforts were made to remedy the evil.<a id="noteref_450"

        Alexander Severus advanced money to the poor to buy portions of land,
        and accepted a gradual payment without interest from the produce of
        the soil. Pertinax settled poor men as proprietors on deserted land,
        on the sole condition that they should cultivate it. Marcus Aurelius
        began, and Aurelian and Valentinian continued, the system of settling
        great numbers of barbarian captives upon the Italian soil, and
        compelling them as slaves to till it. The introduction <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page268">[pg 268]</span><a name="Pg268" id="Pg268"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of this large foreign element into the
        heart of Italy was eventually one of the causes of the downfall of
        the empire, and it is also about this time that we first dimly trace
        the condition of serfdom or servitude to the soil into which slavery
        afterwards faded, and which was for some centuries the general
        condition of the European poor. But the economical and moral causes
        that were destroying agriculture in Italy were too strong to be
        resisted, and the simple habits of life which agricultural pursuits
        promote had little or no place in the later empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A somewhat less
        rapid but in the end not less complete decadence had taken place in
        military life. The Roman army was at first recruited exclusively from
        the upper classes, and the service, which lasted only during actual
        warfare, was gratuitous. Before the close of the Republic, however,
        these conditions had disappeared. Military pay is said to have been
        instituted at the time of the siege of Veii.<a id="noteref_451" name=

        residences in Spain and in the Asiatic provinces discipline gradually
        relaxed, and the historian who traced the progress of Oriental luxury
        in Rome dwelt with a just emphasis upon the ominous fact that it had
        first been introduced into the city by soldiers.<a id="noteref_454"
        name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a> The
        civil wars contributed to the destruction of the old military
        traditions, but being conducted by able generals it is probable that
        they had more effect upon the patriotism than upon the discipline of
        the army. Augustus reorganised the whole military system,
        establishing a body of soldiers known as the Prætorian guard, and
        dignified with some special privileges, permanently in Rome, while
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name=
        "Pg269" id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> other legions were
        chiefly mustered upon the frontiers. During his long reign, and
        during that of Tiberius, both sections were quiescent, but the murder
        of Caligula by his soldiers opened a considerable period of
        insubordination. Claudius, it was observed, first set the fatal
        example of purchasing his safety from his soldiers by bribes.<a id=

        armies of the provinces soon discovered that it was possible to elect
        an emperor outside Rome, and Galba, Otho, Vitellius, and Vespasian
        were all the creatures of revolt. The evil was, however, not yet past
        recovery. Vespasian and Trajan enforced discipline with great
        stringency and success. The emperors began more frequently to visit
        the camps. The number of the soldiers was small, and for some time
        the turbulence subsided. The history of the worst period of the
        Empire, it has been truly observed, is full of instances of brave
        soldiers trying, under circumstances of extreme difficulty, simply to
        do their duty. But the historian had soon occasion to notice again
        the profound influence of the voluptuous Asiatic cities upon the
        legions.<a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href=

        for many years from Italy, they lost all national pride, their
        allegiance was transferred from the sovereign to the general, and
        when the Imperial sceptre fell into the hands of a succession of
        incompetent rulers, they habitually urged their commanders to revolt,
        and at last reduced the empire to a condition of military anarchy. A
        remedy was found for this evil, though not for the luxurious habits
        that had been acquired, in the division of the empire, which placed
        each army under the direct supervision of an emperor, and it is
        probable that at a later period Christianity diminished the
        insubordination, though it may have also diminished the military
        fire, of the soldiers.<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href=
        "#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        other and still more powerful causes were in <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> operation preparing the military downfall of
        Rome. The habits of inactivity which the Imperial policy had
        produced, and which, through a desire for popularity, most emperors
        laboured to encourage, led to a profound disinclination for the
        hardships of military life. Even the Prætorian guard, which was long
        exclusively Italian, was selected after Septimus Severus from the
        legions on the frontiers,<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href=
        "#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> while,
        Italy being relieved from the regular conscription, these were
        recruited solely in the provinces, and innumerable barbarians were
        subsidised. The political and military consequences of this change
        are sufficiently obvious. In an age when, artillery being unknown,
        the military superiority of civilised nations over barbarians was far
        less than at present, the Italians had become absolutely unaccustomed
        to real war, and had acquired habits that were beyond all others
        incompatible with military discipline, while many of the barbarians
        who menaced and at last subverted the empire had been actually
        trained by Roman generals. The moral consequence is equally
        plain—military discipline, like agricultural labour, ceased to have
        any part among the moral influences of Italy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To those who have
        duly estimated the considerations I have enumerated, the downfall and
        moral debasement of the empire can cause no surprise, though they may
        justly wonder that its agony should have been so protracted, that it
        should have produced a multitude of good and great men, both
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271"
        id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> pagan and Christian, and that
        these should have exercised so wide an influence as they
        unquestionably did. Almost every institution or pursuit by which
        virtuous habits would naturally have been formed had been tainted or
        destroyed, while agencies of terrific power were impelling the people
        to vice. The rich, excluded from most honourable paths of ambition,
        and surrounded by countless parasites who inflamed their every
        passion, found themselves absolute masters of innumerable slaves who
        were their willing ministers, and often their teachers, in vice. The
        poor, hating industry and destitute of all intellectual resources,
        lived in habitual idleness, and looked upon abject servility as the
        normal road to fortune. But the picture becomes truly appalling when
        we remember that the main amusement of both classes was the spectacle
        of bloodshed, of the death, and sometimes of the torture, of men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gladiatorial
        games form, indeed, the one feature of Roman society which to a
        modern mind is almost inconceivable in its atrocity. That not only
        men, but women, in an advanced period of civilisation—men and women
        who not only professed but very frequently acted upon a high code of
        morals—should have made the carnage of men their habitual amusement,
        that all this should have continued for centuries, with scarcely a
        protest, is one of the most startling facts in moral history. It is,
        however, perfectly normal, and in no degree inconsistent with the
        doctrine of natural moral perceptions, while it opens out fields of
        ethical enquiry of a very deep though painful interest.</p>

        notwithstanding these attempts to limit them the games soon acquired
        the most gigantic proportions. They were celebrated habitually by
        great men in honour of their dead relatives, by officials on coming
        into office, by conquerors to secure popularity, and on every
        occasion of public rejoicing, and by rich tradesmen who were desirous
        of acquiring a social position.<a id="noteref_473" name="noteref_473"
        href="#note_473"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">473</span></span></a> They
        were also among the attractions of the public baths. Schools of
        gladiators—often the private property of rich citizens—existed in
        every leading city of Italy, and, besides slaves and criminals, they
        were thronged with freemen, who voluntarily hired themselves for a
        term of years. In the eyes of multitudes, the large sums that were
        paid to the victor, the patronage of nobles and often of emperors,
        and still more the delirium of popular enthusiasm that centred upon
        the successful gladiator, outweighed all the dangers of the
        profession. A complete recklessness of life was soon engendered both
        in the spectators and the combatants. The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lanistæ,”</span> or purveyors of gladiators, became an
        important profession. Wandering bands of gladiators traversed Italy,
        hiring themselves for the provincial amphitheatres. The influence of
        the games gradually pervaded the whole texture of Roman life. They
        became the common-place of conversation.<a id="noteref_474" name=

        characteristic relic of pagan Rome.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the provinces
        the same passion was displayed. From Gaul to Syria, wherever the
        Roman influence extended, the spectacles of blood were introduced,
        and the gigantic remains of amphitheatres in many lands still attest
        by their ruined grandeur the scale on which they were pursued. In the
        reign of Tiberius, more than 20,000 persons are said to have perished
        by the fall of the amphitheatre at the suburban town of Fidenæ.<a id=

        some degree an exception. When an attempt was made to introduce the

        <span class="tei tei-q">“You must first overthrow the altar of

        with the exception of Corinth, where a very large foreign population
        existed, Greece never appears to have shared the general

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the first
        consequences of this taste was to render the people absolutely unfit
        for those tranquil and refined amusements which usually accompany
        civilisation. To men who were accustomed to witness the fierce
        vicissitudes of deadly combat, any spectacle that did not elicit the
        strongest excitement was insipid. The only amusements that at all
        rivalled the spectacles of the amphitheatre and the circus were those
        which appealed strongly to the sensual passions, such as the games of
        Flora, the postures of the pantomimes, and the ballet.<a id=
        "noteref_486" name="noteref_486" href="#note_486"><span class=

        comedy, indeed, flourished for a short period, but only by throwing
        itself into the same career. The pander and the courtesan are the
        leading characters of Plautus, and the more modest Terence never
        attained an equal popularity. The different forms of vice have a
        continual tendency to act and react upon one another, and the intense
        craving after excitement which the amphitheatre must necessarily have
        produced, had probably no <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg
        277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        small influence in stimulating the orgies of sensuality which Tacitus
        and Suetonius describe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But if comedy
        could to a certain extent flourish with the gladiatorial games, it
        was not so with tragedy. It is, indeed, true that the tragic actor
        can exhibit displays of more intense agony and of a grander heroism
        than were ever witnessed in the arena. His mission is not to paint
        nature as it exists in the light of day, but nature as it exists in
        the heart of man. His gestures, his tones, his looks, are such as
        would never have been exhibited by the person he represents, but they
        display to the audience the full intensity of the emotions which that
        person would have felt, but which he would have been unable
        adequately to reveal. But to those who were habituated to the intense
        realism of the amphitheatre, the idealised suffering of the stage was
        unimpressive. All the genius of a Siddons or a Ristori would fail to
        move an audience who had continually seen living men fall bleeding
        and mangled at their feet. One of the first functions of the stage is
        to raise to the highest point the susceptibility to disgust. When
        Horace said that Medea should not kill her children upon the stage,
        he enunciated not a mere arbitrary rule, but one which grows
        necessarily out of the development of the drama. It is an essential
        characteristic of a refined and cultivated taste to be shocked and
        offended at the spectacle of bloodshed; and the theatre, which
        somewhat dangerously dissociates sentiment from action, and causes
        men to waste their compassion on ideal sufferings, is at least a
        barrier against the extreme forms of cruelty by developing this
        susceptibility to the highest degree. The gladiatorial games, on the
        other hand, destroyed all sense of disgust, and therefore all
        refinement of taste, and they rendered the permanent triumph of the
        drama impossible.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href=
        "#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is abundantly
        evident, both from history and from present experience, that the
        instinctive shock, or natural feeling of disgust, caused by the sight
        of the sufferings of men is not generically different from that which
        is caused by the sight of the sufferings of animals. The latter, to
        those who are not accustomed to it, is intensely painful. The former
        continually becomes by use a matter of absolute indifference. If the
        repugnance which is felt in the one case appears greater than in the
        other, it is not on account of any innate sentiment which commands us
        to reverence our species, but simply because our imagination finds
        less difficulty in realising human than animal suffering, and also
        because education has strengthened our feelings in the one case much
        more than in the other. There is, however, no fact more clearly
        established than that when men have regarded it as not a crime to
        kill some class of their fellow-men, they have soon learnt to do so
        with no more natural compunction or hesitation than they would
        exhibit in killing a wild animal. This is the normal condition of
        savage men. Colonists and Red Indians even now often shoot each other
        with precisely the same indifference as they shoot beasts of prey,
        and the whole history of warfare—especially when warfare was
        conducted on more savage principles than at present—is an
        illustration of the fact. Startling, therefore, as it may now appear,
        it is in no degree unnatural that Roman spectators should have
        contemplated with perfect equanimity the slaughter of men. The
        Spaniard, who is brought in infancy to the bull-ring, soon learns to
        gaze with indifference or with pleasure upon sights before which the
        unpractised eye of the stranger quails with horror, and the same
        process would be equally efficacious had the spectacle been the
        sufferings of men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We now look back
        with indignation upon this indifference; <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> but yet, although it may be hard to realise, it
        is probably true that there is scarcely a human being who might not
        by custom be so indurated as to share it. Had the most benevolent
        person lived in a country in which the innocence of these games was
        deemed axiomatic, had he been taken to them in his very childhood,
        and accustomed to associate them with his earliest dreams of romance,
        and had he then been left simply to the play of the emotions, the
        first paroxysm of horror would have soon subsided, the shrinking
        repugnance that followed would have grown weaker and weaker, the
        feeling of interest would have been aroused, and the time would
        probably come in which it would reign alone. But even this absolute
        indifference to the sight of human suffering does not represent the
        full evil resulting from the gladiatorial games. That some men are so
        constituted as to be capable of taking a real and lively pleasure in
        the simple contemplation of suffering as suffering, and without any
        reference to their own interests, is a proposition which has been
        strenuously denied by those in whose eyes vice is nothing more than a
        displacement, or exaggeration, of lawful self-regarding feelings, and
        others, who have admitted the reality of the phenomenon, have treated
        it as a very rare and exceptional disease.<a id="noteref_488" name=

        is so—at least in its extreme forms—in the present condition of
        society, may reasonably be hoped, though I imagine that few persons
        who have watched the habits of boys would question that to take
        pleasure in giving at least some degree of pain is sufficiently
        common, and though it is not quite certain that all the sports of
        adult men would be entered into with exactly the same zest if their
        victims were not sentient beings. But in every society in which
        atrocious punishments have been common, this side of human nature
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280"
        id="Pg280" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> has acquired an undoubted
        prominence. It is related of Claudius that his special delight at the
        gladiatorial shows was in watching the countenances of the dying, for
        he had learnt to take an artistic pleasure in observing the
        variations of their agony.<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489"
        href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a> When
        the gladiator lay prostrate it was customary for the spectators to
        give the sign with their thumbs, indicating whether they desired him
        to be spared or slain, and the giver of the show reaped most
        popularity when, in the latter case, he permitted no consideration of
        economy to make him hesitate to sanction the popular award.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides this, the
        mere desire for novelty impelled the people to every excess or
        refinement of barbarity.<a id="noteref_491" name="noteref_491" href=

        simple combat became at last insipid, and every variety of atrocity
        was devised to stimulate the flagging interest. At one time a bear
        and a bull, chained together, rolled in fierce contest along the
        sand; at another, criminals dressed in the skins of wild beasts were
        thrown to bulls, which were maddened by red-hot irons, or by darts
        tipped with burning pitch. Four hundred bears were killed on a single
        day under Caligula; three hundred on another day under Claudius.
        Under Nero, four hundred tigers fought with bulls and elephants; four
        hundred bears and three hundred lions were slaughtered by his
        soldiers. In a single day, at the dedication of the Colosseum by
        Titus, five thousand animals perished. Under Trajan, the games
        continued for one hundred and twenty-three successive days.<a id=

        crocodiles and serpents, were employed to give novelty to the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is well for us
        to look steadily on such facts as these. They display more vividly
        than any mere philosophical disquisition the abyss of depravity into
        which it is possible for human nature to sink. They furnish us with
        striking proofs of the reality of the moral progress we have
        attained, and they enable us in some degree to estimate the
        regenerating influence that Christianity has exercised in the world.
        For the destruction of the gladiatorial games is all its work.
        Philosophers, indeed, might deplore them, gentle natures might shrink
        from their contagion, but to the multitude they possessed a
        fascination which nothing but the new religion could overcome.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nor was this
        fascination surprising, for no pageant has ever combined more
        powerful elements of attraction. The magnificent circus, the gorgeous
        dresses of the assembled Court, the contagion of a passionate
        enthusiasm thrilling almost visibly through the mighty throng, the
        breathless silence of expectation, the wild cheers bursting
        simultaneously from eighty thousand tongues, and echoing to the
        farthest outskirts of the city, the rapid alternations of the fray,
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page283">[pg 283]</span><a name=
        "Pg283" id="Pg283" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> deeds of splendid
        courage that were manifested, were all well fitted to entrance the
        imagination. The crimes and servitude of the gladiator were for a
        time forgotten in the blaze of glory that surrounded him.
        Representing to the highest degree that courage which the Romans
        deemed the first of virtues, the cynosure of countless eyes, the
        chief object of conversation in the metropolis of the universe,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And while the
        influences of the amphitheatre gained a complete ascendancy over the
        populace, the Roman was not without excuses that could lull his moral
        feelings to repose. The games, as I have said, were originally human
        sacrifices—religious rites sacred to the dead—and it was argued that
        the death of the gladiator was both more honourable and more
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page285">[pg 285]</span><a name="Pg285"

        passive victim, who, in the Homeric age, was sacrificed at the tomb.
        The combatants were either professional gladiators, slaves,
        criminals, or military captives. The lot of the first was voluntary.
        The second had for a long time been regarded as almost beneath or
        beyond a freeman's care; but when the enlarging circle of sympathy
        had made the Romans regard their slaves as <span class="tei tei-q">“a
        kind of second human nature,”</span><a id="noteref_516" name=

        perceived the atrocity of exposing them in the games, and an edict of

        permission to fight was regarded as an act of mercy. The fate of the
        fourth could not strike the early Roman with the horror it would now
        inspire, for the right of the conquerors to massacre their prisoners
        was almost universally admitted.<a id="noteref_519" name=

        beyond the point of desiring the games to be in some degree
        restricted, extremely few of the moralists of the Roman Empire ever
        advanced. That it was a horrible and demoralising thing to make the
        spectacle of the deaths, even of guilty men, a form of popular
        amusement, was a position which no Roman school had attained, and
        which was only reached by a very few individuals. Cicero observes,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“that the gladiatorial spectacles appear to
        some cruel and inhuman,”</span> and, he adds, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I know not whether as they are now conducted it is not

        it is true, adopts a far nobler language. He denounced the games with
        a passionate eloquence. He refuted indignantly the argument derived
        from the guilt of the combatants, and declared that under every form
        and modification these amusements were brutalising, savage, and
        detestable.<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href=

        Plutarch went even farther, and condemned the combats of wild beasts
        on the ground that we should have a bond of sympathy with all
        sentient beings, and that the sight of blood and of suffering is
        necessarily and essentially depraving.<a id="noteref_522" name=

        poem on the civil war; Junius Mauricus, who refused to permit the

        remonstrances of the emperor, <span class="tei tei-q">“Would to

        these, with the Athenian remonstrances I have already noticed, are
        almost the only instances now remaining of pagan protests against the
        most conspicuous as well as the most atrocious feature of the age.
        Juvenal, whose unsparing satire has traversed the whole field of
        Roman manners, and who denounces fiercely all cruelty to slaves, has
        repeatedly noticed the gladiatorial shows, but on no single occasion
        does he intimate that they were inconsistent with humanity. Of all
        the great historians who recorded them, not one seems to have been
        conscious that he was recording a barbarity, not one appears to have
        seen in them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page287">[pg
        287]</span><a name="Pg287" id="Pg287" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> any
        greater evils than an increasing tendency to pleasure and the
        excessive multiplication of a dangerous class. The Roman sought to
        make men brave and fearless, rather than gentle and humane, and in
        his eyes that spectacle was to be applauded which steeled the heart
        against the fear of death, even at the sacrifice of the affections.
        Titus and Trajan, in whose reigns, probably, the greatest number of
        shows were compressed into a short time, were both men of conspicuous
        clemency, and no Roman seems to have imagined that the fact of 3,000
        men having been compelled to fight under the one, and 10,000 under
        the other, cast the faintest shadow upon their characters. Suetonius
        mentions, as an instance of the amiability of Titus, that he was
        accustomed to jest with the people during the combats of the
        gladiators,<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href=
        "#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> and
        Pliny especially eulogised Trajan because he did not patronise
        spectacles that enervate the character, but rather those which impel
        men <span class="tei tei-q">“to noble wounds and to the contempt of
        death.”</span><a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href=

        same writer, who was himself in many ways conspicuous for his
        gentleness and charity, having warmly commended a friend for acceding
        to a petition of the people of Verona, who desired a spectacle, adds
        this startling sentence: <span class="tei tei-q">“After so general a
        request, to have refused would not have been firmness—it would have

        the closing years of the fourth century, the præfect Symmachus, who
        was regarded as one of the most estimable pagans of his age,
        collected some Saxon prisoners to fight in honour of his son. They
        strangled themselves in prison, and Symmachus lamented the misfortune
        that had befallen him from their <span class="tei tei-q">“impious
        hands,”</span> but endeavoured to calm his feelings by recalling the
        patience of Socrates and the precepts of philosophy.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While, however, I
        have no desire to disguise or palliate the extreme atrocity of this
        aspect of Roman life, there are certain very natural exaggerations,
        against which it is necessary for us to guard. There are in human
        nature, and more especially in the exercise of the benevolent
        affections, inequalities, inconsistencies, and anomalies, of which
        theorists do not always take account. We should be altogether in
        error if we supposed that a man who took pleasure in a gladiatorial
        combat in ancient Rome was necessarily as inhuman as a modern would
        be who took pleasure in a similar spectacle. A man who falls but a
        little below the standard of his own merciful age is often in reality
        far worse than a man who had conformed to the standard of a much more
        barbarous age, even though the latter will do some things with
        perfect equanimity from which the other would recoil with horror. We
        have a much greater power than is sometimes supposed of localising
        both our benevolent and malevolent feelings. If a man is very kind,
        or very harsh to some particular class, this is usually, and on the
        whole justly, regarded as an index of his general disposition, but
        the inference is not infallible, and it may easily be pushed too far.
        There are some who appear to expend all their kindly feelings on a
        single class, and to treat with perfect indifference all outside it.
        There are others who regard a certain class as quite outside the pale
        of their sympathies, while in other spheres their affections prove
        lively and constant. There are many who would accede without the
        faintest reluctance to a barbarous custom, but would be quite
        incapable of an equally barbarous act which custom had not
        consecrated. Our affections are so capricious in their nature that it
        is continually necessary to correct by detailed experience the most
        plausible deductions. Thus, for example, it is a very unquestionable
        and a very important truth that cruelty to animals naturally
        indicates and promotes a habit of mind which leads to cruelty to men;
        and that, on the other hand, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page289">[pg 289]</span><a name="Pg289" id="Pg289" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> an affectionate and merciful disposition to
        animals commonly implies a gentle and amiable nature. But, if we
        adopted this principle as an infallible criterion of humanity, we
        should soon find ourselves at fault. To the somewhat too hackneyed
        anecdote of Domitian gratifying his savage propensities by killing
        flies,<a id="noteref_529" name="noteref_529" href=
        "#note_529"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">529</span></span></a> we
        might oppose Spinoza, one of the purest, most gentle, most benevolent
        of mankind, of whom it is related that almost the only amusement of
        his life was putting flies into spiders' webs, and watching their
        struggles and their deaths.<a id="noteref_530" name="noteref_530"

        been observed that a very large proportion of the men who during the
        French Revolution proved themselves most absolutely indifferent to
        human suffering were deeply attached to animals. Fournier was devoted
        to a squirrel, Couthon to a spaniel, Panis to two gold pheasants,
        Chaumette to an aviary, Marat kept doves.<a id="noteref_531" name=

        has noticed that the Turks, who are a cruel people, are nevertheless
        conspicuous for their kindness to animals, and he mentions the

        gagging a long-billed fowl.<a id="noteref_532" name="noteref_532"

        elicits a care.<a id="noteref_533" name="noteref_533" href=

        travellers are unanimous in declaring that in Spain an intense
        passion for the bull-fight is quite compatible with the most active
        benevolence and the most amiable disposition. Again, to pass to
        another sphere, it is not uncommon to find conquerors, who will
        sacrifice with perfect callousness great masses of men to their
        ambition, but who, in their dealings with isolated individuals, are
        distinguished by an invariable clemency. Anomalies of this kind
        continually appear in the Roman population. The very men who looked
        down with delight when the sand of the arena was reddened with human
        blood, made the theatre ring with applause when Terence, in his
        famous line, proclaimed the universal brotherhood of man. When the
        senate, being unable to discover the murderer of a patrician,

        real, danger added an evil zest to the performances. In the reign of
        Marcus Aurelius an accident had occurred, and the emperor, with his
        usual sensitive humanity, ordered that no rope-dancer should perform
        without a net or a mattress being spread out below. It is a
        singularly curious fact that this precaution, which no Christian
        nation has adopted, continued in force during more than a century of
        the worst period of the Roman Empire, when the blood of captives was
        poured out like water in the Colosseum.<a id="noteref_540" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The sketch I have
        now drawn will, I think, be sufficient to display the broad chasm
        that existed between the Roman moralists and the Roman people. On the
        one hand we find a system of ethics, of which when we consider the
        range and beauty of its precepts, the sublimity of the motives to
        which it appealed, and its perfect freedom from superstitious
        elements, it is not too much to say that though it may have been
        equalled, it has never been surpassed. On the other hand, we find a
        society almost absolutely destitute of moralising institutions,
        occupations, or beliefs, existing under an economical and political
        system which inevitably led to general depravity, and passionately
        addicted to the most brutalising amusements. The moral code, while it
        expanded in theoretical catholicity, had contracted in practical
        application. The early Romans had a very narrow and imperfect
        standard of duty, but their patriotism, their military system, and
        their enforced simplicity of life had made that standard essentially
        popular. The later Romans had attained a very high and spiritual
        conception of duty, but the philosopher <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page292">[pg 292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> with his group of disciples, or the writer with
        his few readers, had scarcely any point of contact with the people.
        The great practical problem of the ancient philosophers was how they
        could act upon the masses. Simply to tell men what is virtue, and to
        extol its beauty, is insufficient. Something more must be done if the
        characters of nations are to be moulded and inveterate vices
        eradicated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This problem the
        Roman Stoics were incapable of meeting, but they did what lay in
        their power, and their efforts, though altogether inadequate to the
        disease, were by no means contemptible. In the first place they
        raised up many great and good rulers who exerted all the influence of
        their position in the cause of virtue. In most cases these reforms
        were abolished on the accession of the first bad emperor, but there
        were at least some that remained. It has been observed that the
        luxury of the table, which had acquired the most extravagant
        proportions during the period that elapsed between the battle of
        Actium and the reign of Galba, began from this period to decline, and
        the change is chiefly attributed to Vespasian, who had in a measure
        reformed the Roman aristocracy by the introduction of many
        provincials, and who made his court an example of the strictest
        frugality.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href=
        "#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a> The
        period from the accession of Nerva to the death of Marcus Aurelius,
        comprising no less than eighty-four years, exhibits a uniformity of
        good government which no other despotic monarchy has equalled. Each
        of the five emperors who then reigned deserves to be placed among the
        best rulers who have ever lived. Trajan and Hadrian, whose personal
        characters were most defective, were men of great and conspicuous
        genius. Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius, though less distinguished as
        politicians, were among the most perfectly virtuous men who have ever
        sat on a throne. During forty years of this period, perfect, unbroken
        peace reigned <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg
        293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        over the entire civilised globe. The barbarian encroachments had not
        yet begun. The distinct nationalities that composed the Empire,
        gratified by perfect municipal and by perfect intellectual freedom,
        had lost all care for political liberty, and little more than three
        hundred thousand soldiers guarded a territory which is now protected
        by much more than three millions.<a id="noteref_542" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In creating this
        condition of affairs, Stoicism, as the chief moral agent of the
        Empire, had a considerable though not a preponderating influence. In
        other ways its influence was more evident and exclusive. It was a
        fundamental maxim of the sect, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the sage
        should take part in public life,”</span><a id="noteref_543" name=
        "noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a> and it
        was therefore impossible that Stoicism should flourish without
        producing a resuscitation of patriotism. The same moral impulse which
        transformed the Neoplatonist into a dreaming mystic and the Catholic
        into a useless hermit, impelled the Stoic to the foremost post of
        danger in the service of his country. While landmark after landmark
        of Roman virtue was submerged, while luxury and scepticism and
        foreign habits and foreign creeds were corroding the whole framework
        of the national life, amid the last paroxysms of expiring liberty,
        amid the hideous carnival of vice that soon followed upon its fall,
        the Stoic remained unchanged, the representative and the sustainer of
        the past. A party which had acquired the noble title of the Party of
        Virtue, guided by such men as Cato or Thrasea or Helvidius or
        Burrhus, upheld the banner of Roman virtue and Roman liberty in the
        darkest hours of despotism and of apostasy. Like all men who carry an
        intense religious fervour into politics, they were often
        narrow-minded and intolerant, blind to the inevitable changes of
        society, incapable of compromise, turbulent and inopportune in their
        demands,<a id="noteref_544" name="noteref_544" href=
        "#note_544"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">544</span></span></a> but
        they more <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg
        294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        than redeemed their errors by their noble constancy and courage. The
        austere purity of their lives, and the heroic grandeur of their
        deaths, kept alive the tradition of Roman liberty even under a Nero
        or a Domitian. While such men existed it was felt that all was not
        lost. There was still a rallying point of freedom, a seed of virtue
        that might germinate anew, a living protest against the despotism and
        the corruption of the Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A third and still
        more important service which Stoicism rendered to popular morals was
        in the formation of Roman jurisprudence.<a id="noteref_545" name=

        Roman poet the supreme glory of his countrymen, and their
        administrative genius is even now unrivalled in history. A deep
        reverence for law was long one of their chief moral characteristics,
        and in order that it might be inculcated from the earliest years it
        was a part of the Roman system of education to oblige the children to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295"

        laws of the Republic, however, being an expression of the contracted,
        local, military, and sacerdotal spirit that dominated among the

        expansion of the Empire, and the process of renovation which was
        begun under Augustus by the Stoic Labeo,<a id="noteref_547" name=

        continued with great zeal under Hadrian and Alexander Severus, and
        issued in the famous compilations of Theodosius and Justinian. In
        this movement we have to observe two parts. There were certain
        general rules of guidance laid down by the great Roman lawyers which
        constituted what may be called the ideal of the jurisconsults—the
        ends to which their special enactments tended—the principles of
        equity to guide the judge when the law was silent or ambiguous. There
        were also definite enactments to meet specific cases. The first part
        was simply borrowed from the Stoics, whose doctrines and method thus
        passed from the narrow circle of a philosophical academy and became
        the avowed moral beacons of the civilised globe. The fundamental
        difference between Stoicism and early Roman thought was that the
        former maintained the existence of a bond of unity among mankind
        which transcended or annihilated all class or national limitations.
        The essential characteristic of the Stoical method was the assertion
        of the existence of a certain law of nature to which it was the end
        of philosophy to conform. These tenets were laid down in the most
        unqualified language by the Roman lawyers. <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“a custom of the law of nations, by which one

        accordance with these principles it became a maxim among the Roman
        lawyers that in every doubtful case where the alternative of slavery
        or freedom was at issue, the decision of the judge should be towards
        the latter.<a id="noteref_552" name="noteref_552" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Roman
        legislation was in a twofold manner the child of philosophy. It was
        in the first place itself formed upon the philosophical model, for,
        instead of being a mere empirical system adjusted to the existing
        requirements of society, it laid down abstract principles of right to
        which it endeavoured to conform;<a id="noteref_553" name=
        "noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a> and, in
        the next place, these principles were borrowed directly from
        Stoicism. The prominence the sect had acquired among Roman moralists,
        its active intervention in public affairs, and also the precision and
        brevity of its phraseology, had recommended it to the lawyers,<a id=
        "noteref_554" name="noteref_554" href="#note_554"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">554</span></span></a> and the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page297">[pg 297]</span><a name="Pg297"
        id="Pg297" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> union then effected between
        the legal and philosophical spirit is felt to the present day. To the
        Stoics and the Roman lawyers is mainly due the clear recognition of
        the existence of a law of nature above and beyond all human
        enactments which has been the basis of the best moral and of the most
        influential though most chimerical political speculation of later
        ages, and the renewed study of Roman law was an important element in
        the revival that preceded the Reformation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
        necessary for my present purpose to follow into very minute detail
        the application of these principles to practical legislation. It is
        sufficient to say, that there were few departments into which the
        catholic and humane principles of Stoicism were not in some degree
        carried. In the political world, as we have already seen, the right
        of Roman citizenship, with the protection and the legal privileges
        attached to it, from being the monopoly of a small class, was
        gradually but very widely diffused. In the domestic sphere, the power
        which the old laws had given to the father of the family, though not
        destroyed, was greatly abridged, and an important innovation, which
        is well worthy of a brief notice, was thus introduced into the social
        system of the Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
        that in the chronology of morals, domestic virtue takes the
        precedence of all others; but in its earliest phase it consists of a
        single article—the duty of absolute submission to the head of the
        household. It is only at a later period, and when the affections have
        been in some degree evoked, that the reciprocity of duty is felt, and
        the whole tendency of civilisation is to diminish the disparity
        between the different members of the family. The process by which the
        wife from a simple slave becomes the companion and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> equal of her husband, I shall endeavour
        to trace in a future chapter. The relations of the father to his
        children are profoundly modified by the new position the affections
        assume in education, which in a rude nation rests chiefly upon
        authority, but in a civilised community upon sympathy. In Rome the
        absolute authority of the head of the family was the centre and
        archetype of that whole system of discipline and subordination which
        it was the object of the legislator to sustain. Filial reverence was
        enforced as the first of duties. It is the one virtue which Virgil
        attributed in any remarkable degree to the founder of the race. The
        marks of external respect paid to old men were scarcely less than in
        Sparta.<a id="noteref_555" name="noteref_555" href=
        "#note_555"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">555</span></span></a> It was
        the boast of the lawyers that in no other nation had the parent so
        great an authority over his children.<a id="noteref_556" name=
        "noteref_556" href="#note_556"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">556</span></span></a> The
        child was indeed the absolute slave of his father, who had a right at
        any time to take away his life and dispose of his entire property. He
        could look to no time during the life of his father in which he would
        be freed from the thraldom. The man of fifty, the consul, the
        general, or the tribune, was in this respect in the same position as
        the infant, and might at any moment be deprived of all the earnings
        of his labour, driven to the most menial employments, or even put to
        death, by the paternal command.<a id="noteref_557" name="noteref_557"
        href="#note_557"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can, I
        think, be little question that this law, at least in the latter
        period of its existence, defeated its own <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page299">[pg 299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> object. There are few errors of education to
        which more unhappy homes may be traced than this—that parents have
        sought to command the obedience, before they have sought to win the
        confidence, of their children. This was the path which the Roman
        legislator indicated to the parent, and its natural consequence was
        to chill the sympathies and arouse the resentment of the young. Of
        all the forms of virtue filial affection is perhaps that which
        appears most rarely in Roman history. In the plays of Plautus it is
        treated much as conjugal fidelity was treated in England by the
        playwriters of the Restoration. An historian of the reign of Tiberius
        has remarked that the civil wars were equally remarkable for the many
        examples they supplied of the devotion of wives to their husbands, of
        the devotion of slaves to their masters, and of the treachery or
        indifference of sons to their fathers.<a id="noteref_558" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reforms that
        were effected during the pagan empire did not reconstruct the family,
        but they at least greatly mitigated its despotism. The profound
        change of feeling that had taken place on the subject is shown by the
        contrast between the respectful, though somewhat shrinking,
        acquiescence, with which the ancient Romans regarded parents who had
        put their children to death,<a id="noteref_559" name="noteref_559"
        href="#note_559"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        indignation excited under Augustus by the act of Erixo. Hadrian,
        apparently by a stretch of despotic power, banished a man who had
        assassinated his son.<a id="noteref_560" name="noteref_560" href=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> not seriously repressed, but the right of
        putting to death an adult child had long been obsolete, when
        Alexander Severus formally withdrew it from the father. The property
        of children was also in some slight degree protected. A few instances
        are recorded of wills that were annulled because they had
        disinherited legitimate sons,<a id="noteref_561" name="noteref_561"
        href="#note_561"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Hadrian, following a policy that had been feebly initiated by his two
        predecessors, gave the son an absolute possession of whatever he
        might gain in the military service. Diocletian rendered the sale of
        children by the fathers, in all cases, illegal.<a id="noteref_562"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the field of
        slavery the legislative reforms were more important. This
        institution, indeed, is one that meets us at every turn of the moral
        history of Rome, and on two separate occasions in the present chapter
        I have already had occasion to notice it. I have shown that the great
        prominence of the slave element in Roman life was one of the causes
        of the enlargement of sympathies that characterises the philosophy of
        the Empire, and also that slavery was in a very high degree, and in
        several distinct ways, a cause of the corruption of the free classes.
        In considering the condition of the slaves themselves, we may
        distinguish, I think, three periods. In the earlier and simpler days
        of the Republic, the head of the family was absolute master of his
        slaves, but circumstances in a great measure mitigated the evil of
        the despotism. The slaves were very few in number. Each Roman
        proprietor had commonly one or two who assisted him in cultivating
        the soil, and superintended his property when he was absent in the
        army. In the frugal habits of the time, the master was brought into
        the most intimate connection with his <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> slaves. He shared their labours and their food,
        and the control he exercised over them, in most cases probably
        differed little from that which he exercised over his sons. Under
        such circumstances, great barbarity to slaves, though always
        possible, was not likely to be common, and the protection of religion
        was added to the force of habit. Hercules, the god of labour, was the
        special patron of slaves. There was a legend that Sparta had once
        been nearly destroyed by an earthquake sent by Neptune to avenge the
        treacherous murder of some Helots.<a id="noteref_563" name=
        "noteref_563" href="#note_563"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">563</span></span></a> In
        Rome, it was said, Jupiter had once in a dream commissioned a man to
        express to the senate the divine anger at the cruel treatment of a
        slave during the public games.<a id="noteref_564" name="noteref_564"
        href="#note_564"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">564</span></span></a> By the
        pontifical law, slaves were exempted from field labours on the
        religious festivals.<a id="noteref_565" name="noteref_565" href=
        "#note_565"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">565</span></span></a> The
        Saturnalia and Matronalia, which were especially intended for their
        benefit, were the most popular holidays in Rome, and on these
        occasions the slaves were accustomed to sit at the same table with
        their masters.<a id="noteref_566" name="noteref_566" href=
        "#note_566"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Even at this time,
        however, it is probable that great atrocities were occasionally
        committed. Everything was permitted by law, although it is probable
        that the censor in cases of extreme abuse might interfere, and the
        aristocratic feelings of the early Roman, though corrected in a
        measure by the associations of daily labour, sometimes broke out in a
        fierce scorn for all classes but his own. The elder Cato, who may be
        regarded as a type of the Romans of the earlier period, speaks of
        slaves simply as instruments for obtaining wealth, and he encouraged
        masters, both by his precept and his example, to sell them as useless
        when aged and infirm.<a id="noteref_567" name="noteref_567" href=
        "#note_567"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the second
        period, the condition of slaves had greatly deteriorated. The
        victories of Rome, especially in the East, had introduced into the
        city innumerable slaves<a id="noteref_568" name="noteref_568" href=
        "#note_568"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">568</span></span></a> and the
        wildest luxury, and the despotism of the master remained unqualified
        by law, while the habits of life that had originally mitigated it had
        disappeared. The religious sentiments of the people were at the same
        time fatally impaired, and many new causes conspired to aggravate the
        evil. The passion for gladiatorial shows had begun, and it
        continually produced a savage indifference to the infliction of pain.
        The servile wars of Sicily, and the still more formidable revolt of
        Spartacus, had shaken Italy to the centre, and the shock was felt in
        every household. <span class="tei tei-q">“As many enemies as
        slaves,”</span> had become a Roman proverb. The fierce struggles of
        barbarian captives were repaid by fearful punishments, and many
        thousands of revolted slaves perished on the cross. An atrocious law,
        intended to secure the safety of the citizens, provided that if a
        master were murdered, all the slaves in his house, who were not in
        chains or absolutely helpless through illness, should be put to
        death.<a id="noteref_569" name="noteref_569" href=
        "#note_569"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">569</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Numerous acts of
        the most odious barbarity were committed. The well-known anecdotes of
        Flaminius ordering a slave to be killed to gratify, by the spectacle,
        the curiosity of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
        303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
        guest; of Vedius Pollio feeding his fish on the flesh of slaves; and
        of Augustus sentencing a slave, who had killed and eaten a favourite
        quail, to crucifixion, are the extreme examples that are recorded;
        for we need not regard as an historical fact the famous picture in
        Juvenal of a Roman lady, in a moment of caprice, ordering her
        unoffending servant to be crucified. We have, however, many other
        very horrible glimpses of slave life at the close of the Republic and
        in the early days of the Empire. The marriage of slaves was entirely
        unrecognised by law, and in their case the words adultery, incest, or
        polygamy had no legal meaning. Their testimony was in general only
        received in the law-courts when they were under torture. When
        executed for a crime, their deaths were of a most hideous kind. The
        ergastula, or private prisons, of the masters were frequently their
        only sleeping-places. Old and infirm slaves were constantly exposed
        to perish on an island of the Tiber. We read of slaves chained as
        porters to the doors, and cultivating the fields in chains. Ovid and
        Juvenal describe the fierce Roman ladies tearing their servants'
        faces, and thrusting the long pins of their brooches into their
        flesh. The master, at the close of the Republic, had full power to
        sell his slave as a gladiator, or as a combatant with wild
        beasts.<a id="noteref_570" name="noteref_570" href=
        "#note_570"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this is very
        horrible, but it must not be forgotten that there was another side to
        the picture. It is the custom of many ecclesiastical writers to paint
        the pagan society of the Empire as a kind of pandemonium, and with
        this object they collect the facts I have cited, which are for the
        most part narrated by Roman satirists or historians, as examples of
        the most extreme and revolting cruelty; they represent them as fair
        specimens of the ordinary treatment of the servile class, and they
        simply exclude from their consideration <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the many qualifying facts that might be
        alleged. Although the marriage of a slave was not legally recognised,
        it was sanctioned by custom, and it does not appear to have been
        common to separate his family.<a id="noteref_571" name="noteref_571"
        href="#note_571"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">571</span></span></a> Two
        customs to which I have already referred distinguish ancient slavery
        broadly from that of modern times. The peculium, or private property
        of slaves, was freely recognised by masters, to whom, however, after
        the death of the slave, part or all of it usually reverted,<a id=
        "noteref_572" name="noteref_572" href="#note_572"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">572</span></span></a> though
        some masters permitted their slaves to dispose of it by will.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">573</span></span></a> The
        enfranchisement of slaves was also carried on to such an extent as
        seriously to affect the population of the city. It appears from a
        passage in Cicero that an industrious and well-conducted captive
        might commonly look forward to his freedom in six years.<a id=

        Isolated acts of great cruelty undoubtedly occurred; but public
        opinion strongly reprehended them, and Seneca assures us that masters
        who ill-treated their slaves were pointed at and insulted in the
        streets.<a id="noteref_575" name="noteref_575" href=

        slave was not necessarily the degraded being he has since appeared.
        The physician who tended the Roman in his sickness, the tutor to whom
        he confided the education of his son, the artists whose works
        commanded the admiration of the city, were usually slaves. Slaves
        sometimes mixed with their masters in the family, ate habitually with
        them at the same table,<a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href=
        "#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a> and
        were regarded by them with the warmest affection. Tiro, the slave and
        afterwards the freedman of Cicero, compiled his master's letters, and
        has preserved some in which Cicero addressed <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> him in terms of the most sincere and delicate
        friendship. I have already referred to the letter in which the
        younger Pliny poured out his deep sorrow for the death of some of his
        slaves, and endeavoured to console himself with the thought that as
        he had emancipated them before their death, at least they had died
        free.<a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href=
        "#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a>
        Epictetus passed at once from slavery to the friendship of an
        emperor.<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href=
        "#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> The
        great multiplication of slaves, though it removed them from the
        sympathy of their masters, must at least have in most cases
        alleviated their burdens. The application of torture to slave
        witnesses, horrible as it was, was a matter of rare occurrence, and
        was carefully restricted by law.<a id="noteref_579" name=
        "noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> Much
        vice was undoubtedly fostered, but yet the annals of the civil wars
        and of the Empire are crowded with the most splendid instances of the
        fidelity of slaves. In many cases they refused the boon of liberty
        and defied the most horrible tortures rather than betray their
        masters, accompanied them in their flight when all others had
        abandoned them, displayed undaunted courage and untiring ingenuity in
        rescuing them from danger, and in some cases saved the lives of their
        owners by the deliberate sacrifice of their own.<a id="noteref_580"
        name="noteref_580" href="#note_580"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">580</span></span></a> This
        was, indeed, for some time the pre-eminent virtue of Rome, and it
        proves conclusively that the masters were not so tyrannical, and that
        the slaves were not so degraded, as is sometimes alleged.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The duty of
        humanity to slaves had been at all times one <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> of those which the philosophers had most
        ardently inculcated. Plato and Aristotle, Zeno and Epicurus, were, on
        this point, substantially agreed.<a id="noteref_581" name=
        "noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> The
        Roman Stoics gave the duty a similar prominence in their teaching,
        and Seneca especially has filled pages with exhortations to masters
        to remember that the accident of position in no degree affects the
        real dignity of men, that the slave may be free by virtue while the
        master may be a slave by vice, and that it is the duty of a good man
        to abstain not only from all cruelty, but even from all feeling of
        contempt towards his slaves.<a id="noteref_582" name="noteref_582"
        href="#note_582"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">582</span></span></a> But
        these exhortations, in which some have imagined that they have
        discovered the influence of Christianity, were, in fact, simply an
        echo of the teaching of ancient Greece, and especially of Zeno, the
        founder of Stoicism, who had laid down, long before the dawn of
        Christianity, the broad principles that 'all men are by nature equal,
        and that virtue alone establishes a difference between them.'<a id=
        "noteref_583" name="noteref_583" href="#note_583"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">583</span></span></a> The
        softening influence of the peace of the Antonines assisted this
        movement of humanity, and the slaves derived a certain incidental
        benefit from one of the worst features of the despotism of the
        Cæsars. The emperors, who continually apprehended plots against their
        lives or power, encouraged numerous spies around the more important
        of their subjects, and the facility with which slaves could discover
        the proceedings of their masters inclined the Government in their
        favour.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under all these
        influences many laws were promulgated <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page307">[pg 307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> which profoundly altered the legal position of
        the slaves, and opened what may be termed the third period of Roman
        slavery. The Petronian law, which was issued by Augustus, or, more
        probably, by Nero, forbade the master to condemn his slave to combat
        with wild beasts without a sentence from a judge.<a id="noteref_584"
        name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a> Under
        Claudius, some citizens exposed their sick slaves on the island of
        Æsculapius in the Tiber, to avoid the trouble of tending them, and
        the emperor decreed that if the slave so exposed recovered from his
        sickness he should become free, and also, that masters who killed
        their slaves instead of exposing them should be punished as
        murderers.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href=
        "#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a> It is
        possible that succour was afforded to the abandoned slave in the
        temple of Æsculapius,<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href=
        "#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a> and it
        would appear from these laws that the wanton slaughter of a slave was
        already illegal. About this time the statue of the emperor had become
        an asylum for slaves.<a id="noteref_587" name="noteref_587" href=
        "#note_587"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">587</span></span></a> Under
        Nero, a judge was appointed to hear their complaints, and was
        instructed to punish masters who treated them with barbarity, made
        them the instruments of lust, or withheld from them a sufficient
        quantity of the necessaries of life.<a id="noteref_588" name=
        "noteref_588" href="#note_588"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">588</span></span></a> A
        considerable pause appears to have ensued; but Domitian made a law,
        which was afterwards reiterated, forbidding the Oriental custom of
        mutilating slaves for sensual purposes, and the reforms were renewed
        with great energy in the period of the Antonines. Hadrian and his two
        successors formally deprived masters of the right of killing their
        slaves; forbade them to sell slaves to the lanistæ, or speculators in
        gladiators; destroyed the ergastula, or private prisons; ordered
        that, when a master was murdered, those slaves only should be
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg 308]</span><a name="Pg308"
        id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tortured who were within
        hearing;<a id="noteref_589" name="noteref_589" href=
        "#note_589"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">589</span></span></a>
        appointed officers through all the provinces to hear the complaints
        of slaves; enjoined that no master should treat his slaves with
        excessive severity; and commanded that, when such severity was
        proved, the master should be compelled to sell the slave he had
        ill-treated.<a id="noteref_590" name="noteref_590" href=
        "#note_590"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">590</span></span></a> When we
        add to these laws the broad maxims of equity asserting the essential
        equality of the human race, which the jurists had borrowed from the
        Stoics, and which supplied the principles to guide the judges in
        their decisions, it must be admitted that the slave code of Imperial
        Rome compares not unfavourably with those of some Christian
        nations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While a
        considerable portion of the principles, and even much of the
        phraseology, of Stoicism passed into the system of public law, the
        Roman philosophers had other more direct means of acting on the
        people. On occasions of family bereavement, when the mind is most
        susceptible of impressions, they were habitually called in to console
        the survivors. Dying men asked their comfort and support in the last
        hours of their life. They became the directors of conscience to
        numbers who resorted to them for a solution of perplexing cases of
        practical morals, or under the influence of despondency or
        remorse.<a id="noteref_591" name="noteref_591" href=
        "#note_591"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        had their special exhortations <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> for every vice, and their remedies adapted to
        every variety of character. Many cases were cited of the conversion
        of the vicious or the careless, who had been sought out and
        fascinated by the philosopher,<a id="noteref_592" name="noteref_592"
        href="#note_592"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">592</span></span></a> and
        who, under his guidance, had passed through a long course of moral
        discipline, and had at last attained a high degree of virtue.
        Education fell in a great degree into their hands. Many great
        families kept a philosopher among them in what in modern language
        might be termed the capacity of a domestic chaplain,<a id=
        "noteref_593" name="noteref_593" href="#note_593"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">593</span></span></a> while a
        system of popular preaching was created and widely diffused.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of these preachers
        there were two classes who differed greatly in their characters and
        their methods. The first, who have been very happily termed the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“monks of Stoicism,”</span><a id=
        "noteref_594" name="noteref_594" href="#note_594"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">594</span></span></a> were
        the Cynics, who appear to have assumed among the later moralists of
        the Pagan empire a position somewhat resembling that of the mendicant
        orders in Catholicism. In a singularly curious dissertation of
        Epictetus,<a id="noteref_595" name="noteref_595" href=
        "#note_595"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">595</span></span></a> we have
        a picture of the ideal at which a Cynic should aim, and it is
        impossible in reading it not to be struck by the resemblance it bears
        to the missionary friar. The Cynic should be a man devoting his
        entire life to the instruction of mankind. He must be unmarried, for
        he must have no family affections to divert or to dilute his
        energies. He must wear the meanest dress, sleep upon the bare ground,
        feed upon the simplest food, abstain from all earthly pleasures, and
        yet exhibit to the world the example of uniform cheerfulness and
        content. No one, under pain of provoking the Divine anger, should
        embrace such a career, unless he believes himself to be called
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page310">[pg 310]</span><a name="Pg310"
        id="Pg310" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and assisted by Jupiter. It is
        his mission to go among men as the ambassador of God, rebuking, in
        season and out of season, their frivolity, their cowardice, and their
        vice. He must stop the rich man in the market-place. He must preach
        to the populace in the highway. He must know no respect and no fear.
        He must look upon all men as his sons, and upon all women as his
        daughters. In the midst of a jeering crowd, he must exhibit such a
        placid calm that men may imagine him to be of stone. Ill-treatment,
        and exile, and death must have no terror in his eyes, for the
        discipline of his life should emancipate him from every earthly tie;
        and, when he is beaten, <span class="tei tei-q">“he should love those
        who beat him, for he is at once the father and the brother of all
        men.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A curious contrast
        to the Cynic was the philosophic rhetorician, who gathered around his
        chair all that was most brilliant in Roman or Athenian society. The
        passion for oratory which the free institutions of Greece had formed,
        had survived the causes that produced it, and given rise to a very
        singular but a very influential profession; which, though excluded
        from the Roman Republic, acquired a great development after the
        destruction of political liberty. The rhetoricians were a kind of
        itinerant lecturers, who went about from city to city, delivering
        harangues that were often received with the keenest interest. For the
        most part, neither their characters nor their talents appear to have
        deserved much respect. Numerous anecdotes are recorded of their
        vanity and rapacity, and their success was a striking proof of the
        decadence of public taste.<a id="noteref_596" name="noteref_596"
        href="#note_596"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">596</span></span></a> They
        had cultivated the histrionic <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> part of oratory with the most minute attention.
        The arrangement of their hair, the folds of their dresses, all their
        postures and gestures were studied with artistic care. They had
        determined the different kinds of action that are appropriate for
        each branch of a discourse and for each form of eloquence. Sometimes
        they personated characters in Homer or in ancient Greek history, and
        delivered speeches which those characters might have delivered in
        certain conjunctures of their lives. Sometimes they awakened the
        admiration of their audience by making a fly, a cockroach, dust,
        smoke, a mouse, or a parrot the subject of their eloquent
        eulogy.<a id="noteref_597" name="noteref_597" href=
        "#note_597"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">597</span></span></a> Others,
        again, exercised their ingenuity in defending some glaring paradox or
        sophism, or in debating some intricate case of law or morals, or they
        delivered literary lectures remarkable for a minute but captious and
        fastidious criticism. Some of the rhetoricians recited only harangues
        prepared with the most elaborate care, others were ready debaters,
        and they travelled from city to city, challenging opponents to
        discuss some subtle and usually frivolous question. The poet Juvenal
        and the satirist Lucian had both for a time followed this profession.
        Many of the most eminent acquired immense wealth, travelled with a
        splendid retinue, and excited transports of enthusiasm in the cities
        they visited. They were often charged by cities to appear before the
        emperor to plead for a remission of taxes, or of the punishment due
        for some offence. They became in a great measure the educators of the
        people, and contributed very largely to form and direct their
        taste.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had been from
        the first the custom of some philosophers to adopt this profession,
        and to expound in the form of rhetorical lectures the principles of
        their school. In the Flavian period and in the age of the Antonines,
        this alliance of philosophy, and especially of Stoical philosophy,
        with rhetoric became more marked, and the foundation of liberally
        endowed chairs of rhetoric and philosophy by Vespasian, Hadrian, and
        Marcus Aurelius contributed to sustain it. Discourses of the
        Platonist Maximus of Tyre, and of the Stoic Dion Chrysostom, have
        come down to us, and they are both of a high order of intrinsic
        merit. The first turn chiefly on such subjects as the comparative
        excellence of active and contemplative life, the pure and noble
        conceptions of the Divine nature which underlie the fables or
        allegories of Homer, the dæmon of Socrates, the Platonic notions of
        the Divinity, the duty of prayer, the end of philosophy, and the
        ethics of love.<a id="noteref_598" name="noteref_598" href=

        Chrysostom, in his orations, expounded the noblest and purest theism,
        examined the place which images should occupy in worship, advocated
        humanity to slaves, and was, perhaps, the earliest writer in the
        Roman Empire who denounced hereditary slavery as illegitimate.<a id=

        life was very eventful and very noble. He had become famous as a
        sophist and rhetorician, skilled in the laborious frivolities of the
        profession. Calamity, however, and the writings of Plato induced him
        to abandon them and devote himself exclusively to the improvement of
        mankind. Having defended with a generous rashness a man who had been
        proscribed by the tyranny of Domitian, he was compelled to fly from
        Rome in the garb of a beggar; and, carrying with him only a work of
        Plato and a speech of Demosthenes, he travelled to the most distant
        frontiers of the empire. He gained his livelihood by the work of his
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313"
        id="Pg313" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> hands, for he refused to
        receive money for his discourses; but he taught and captivated the
        Greek colonists who were scattered among the barbarians, and even the
        barbarians themselves. Upon the assassination of Domitian, when the
        legions hesitated to give their allegiance to Nerva, the eloquence of
        Dion Chrysostom overcame their irresolution. By the same eloquence he
        more than once appeased seditions in Alexandria and the Greek cities
        of Asia Minor. He preached before Trajan on the duties of royalty,
        taking a line of Homer for his text. He electrified the vast and
        polished audience assembled at Athens for the Olympic games as he had
        before done the rude barbarians of Scythia. Though his taste was by
        no means untainted by the frivolities of the rhetorician, he was
        skilled in all the arts that awaken curiosity and attention, and his
        eloquence commanded the most various audiences in the most distant
        lands. His special mission, however, was to popularise Stoicism by
        diffusing its principles through the masses of mankind.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The names, and in
        some cases a few fragments, of the writings of many other rhetorical
        philosophers, such as Herod Atticus, Favorinus, Fronto, Taurus,
        Fabianus, and Julianus, have come down to us, and each was the centre
        of a group of passionate admirers, and contributed to form a literary
        society in the great cities of the empire. We have a vivid picture of
        this movement in the <span class="tei tei-q">“Attic Nights”</span> of
        Aulus Gellius—a work which is, I think, one of the most curious and
        instructive in Latin literature, and which bears to the literary
        society of the period of the Antonines much the same relation as the
        writings of Helvétius bear to the Parisian society on the eve of the
        Revolution. Helvétius, it is said, collected the materials for his
        great work on <span class="tei tei-q">“Mind”</span> chiefly from the
        conversation of the drawing-rooms of Paris at a time when that
        conversation had attained a degree of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page314">[pg 314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> perfection which even Frenchmen had never
        before equalled. He wrote in the age of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Encyclopædia,”</span> when the social and political
        convulsions of the Revolution were as yet unfelt; when the first
        dazzling gleams of intellectual freedom had flashed upon a society
        long clouded by superstition and aristocratic pride; when the genius
        of Voltaire and the peerless conversational powers of Diderot,
        irradiating the bold philosophies of Bacon and Locke, had kindled an
        intellectual enthusiasm through all the ranks of fashion;<a id=

        when the contempt for the wisdom and the methods of the past was only
        equalled by the prevailing confidence in the future. Brilliant,
        graceful, versatile, and superficial, with easy eloquence and lax
        morals, with a profound disbelief in moral excellence, and an intense
        appreciation of intellectual beauty, disdaining all pedantry,
        superstition, and mystery, and with an almost fanatical persuasion of
        the omnipotence of analysis, he embodied the principles of his
        contemporaries in a philosophy which represents all virtue and
        heroism as but disguised self-interest; he illustrated every
        argument, not by the pedantic learning of the schools, but by the
        sparkling anecdotes and acute literary criticisms of the
        drawing-room, and he thus produced a work which, besides its
        intrinsic merits, was the most perfect mirror of the society from
        which it sprang.<a id="noteref_602" name="noteref_602" href=

        different, both in form, subject, and tendency, but no less truly
        representative, was the work of Aulus Gellius. It is the journal, or
        common-place book, or miscellany of a scholar moving in the centre of
        the literary society of both Rome and Athens during the latter period
        of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page315">[pg 315]</span><a name=
        "Pg315" id="Pg315" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Antonines,
        profoundly imbued with its spirit, and devoting his leisure to
        painting its leading figures, and compiling the substance of their
        teaching. Few books exhibit a more curious picture of the combination
        of intense child-like literary and moral enthusiasm with the most
        hopeless intellectual degeneracy. Each prominent philosopher was
        surrounded by a train of enthusiastic disciples, who made the
        lecture-room resound with their applause,<a id="noteref_603" name=
        "noteref_603" href="#note_603"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">603</span></span></a> and
        accepted him as their monitor in all the affairs of life. He rebuked
        publicly every instance of vice or of affectation he had observed in
        their conduct, received them at his own table, became their friend
        and confidant in their troubles, and sometimes assisted them by his
        advice in their professional duties.<a id="noteref_604" name=
        "noteref_604" href="#note_604"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">604</span></span></a> Taurus,
        Favorinus, Fronto, and Atticus were the most prominent figures, and
        each seems to have formed, in the centre of a corrupt society, a
        little company of young men devoted with the simplest and most ardent
        earnestness to the cultivation of intellectual and moral excellence.
        Yet this society was singularly puerile. The age of genius had
        closed, and the age of pedantry had succeeded it. Minute, curious,
        and fastidious verbal criticism of the great writers of the past was
        the chief occupation of the scholar, and the whole tone of his mind
        had become retrospective and even archaic. Ennius was esteemed a
        greater poet than Virgil, and Cato a greater prose writer than
        Cicero. It was the affectation of some to tesselate their
        conversation with antiquated and obsolete words.<a id="noteref_605"
        name="noteref_605" href="#note_605"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">605</span></span></a> The
        study of etymologies had risen into great favour, and curious
        questions of grammar and pronunciation <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> were ardently debated. Logic, as in most ages
        of intellectual poverty, was greatly studied and prized. Bold
        speculations and original thought had almost ceased, but it was the
        delight of the philosophers to throw the arguments of great writers
        into the form of syllogisms, and to debate them according to the
        rules of the schools. The very amusements of the scholars took the
        form of a whimsical and puerile pedantry. Gellius recalls, with a
        thrill of emotion, those enchanting evenings when, their more serious
        studies being terminated, the disciples of Taurus assembled at the
        table of their master to pass the happy hours in discussing such
        questions as when a man can be said to die, whether in the last
        moment of life or in the first moment of death; or when he can be
        said to get up, whether when he is still on his bed or when he has
        just left it.<a id="noteref_606" name="noteref_606" href=
        "#note_606"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">606</span></span></a>
        Sometimes they proposed to one another literary questions, as what
        old writer had employed some common word in a sense that had since
        become obsolete; or they discussed such syllogisms as
        these:—<span class="tei tei-q">“You have what you have not lost; you
        have not lost horns, therefore you have horns.”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You are not what I am. I am a man; therefore you are not
        a man.”</span><a id="noteref_607" name="noteref_607" href=
        "#note_607"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">607</span></span></a> As
        moralists, they exhibited a very genuine love of moral excellence,
        but the same pedantic and retrospective character. They were
        continually dilating on the regulations of the censors and the
        customs of the earliest period of the Republic. They acquired the
        habit of never enforcing the simplest lesson without illustrating it
        by a profusion of ancient examples and by detached sentences from
        some philosopher, which they employed much as texts of Scripture are
        often employed in the writings of the Puritans.<a id="noteref_608"
        name="noteref_608" href="#note_608"><span class=

        all, they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg

        delighted in cases of conscience, which they discussed with the
        subtilty of the schoolmen.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Lactantius has
        remarked that the Stoics were especially noted for the popular or
        democratic character of their teaching.<a id="noteref_609" name=
        "noteref_609" href="#note_609"><span class=

        their success in this respect their alliance with the rhetoricians
        probably largely contributed; but in other ways it hastened the
        downfall of the school. The useless speculations, refinements, and
        paradoxes which the subtle genius of Chrysippus had connected with
        the simple morals of Stoicism, had been for the most part thrown into
        the background by the early Roman Stoics; but in the teaching of the
        rhetoricians they became supreme. The endowments given by the
        Antonines to philosophers attracted a multitude of impostors, who
        wore long beards and the dress of the philosopher, but whose lives
        were notoriously immoral. The Cynics especially, professing to reject
        the ordinary conventionalities of society, and being under none of
        that discipline or superintendence which in the worst period has
        secured at least external morality among the mendicant monks,
        continually threw off every vestige of virtue and of decency. Instead
        of moulding great characters and inspiring heroic actions, Stoicism
        became a school of the idlest casuistry, or the cloak for manifest
        imposture.<a id="noteref_610" name="noteref_610" href=
        "#note_610"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">610</span></span></a> The
        very generation which saw Marcus Aurelius on the throne, saw also the
        extinction of the influence of his sect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The internal
        causes of the decadence of Stoicism, though very powerful, are
        insufficient to explain this complete <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> eclipse. The chief cause must be found in the
        fact that the minds of men had taken a new turn, and their enthusiasm
        was flowing rapidly in the direction of Oriental religions, and,
        under the guidance of Plotinus, Porphyry, Iamblichus, and Proclus, of
        a mythical philosophy which was partly Egyptian and partly Platonic.
        It remains for me, in concluding this review of the Pagan empire, to
        indicate and explain this last transformation of Pagan morals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in the
        first place a very natural reaction against the extreme aridity of
        the Stoical casuistry, and also against the scepticism which Sextus
        Empiricus had revived, and in this respect it represents a law of the
        human mind which has been more than once illustrated in later times.
        Thus, the captious, unsatisfying, intellectual subtleties of the
        schoolmen were met by the purely emotional and mystical school of St.
        Bonaventura, and afterwards of Tauler, and thus the adoration of the
        human intellect, that was general in the philosophy of the last
        century, prepared the way for the complete denial of its competency
        by De Maistre and by Lamennais.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the next place,
        mysticism was a normal continuation of the spiritualising movement
        which had long been advancing. We have already seen that the strong
        tendency of ethics, from Cato to Marcus Aurelius, was to enlarge the
        prominence of the emotions in the type of virtue. The formation of a
        gentle, a spiritual, and, in a word, a religious character had become
        a prominent part of moral culture, and it was regarded not simply as
        a means, but as an end. Still, both Marcus Aurelius and Cato were
        Stoics. They both represented the same general cast or conception of
        virtue, although in Marcus Aurelius the type had been profoundly
        modified. But the time was soon to come when the balance between the
        practical and the emotional parts of virtue, which had been steadily
        changing, should be decisively turned <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page319">[pg 319]</span><a name="Pg319" id="Pg319" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> in favour of the latter, and the type of
        Stoicism was then necessarily discarded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A concurrence of
        political and commercial causes had arisen, very favourable to the
        propagation of Oriental beliefs. Commerce had produced a constant
        intercourse between Egypt and Italy. Great numbers of Oriental
        slaves, passionately devoted to their national religions, existed in
        Rome; and Alexandria, which combined a great intellectual development
        with a geographical and commercial position exceedingly favourable to
        a fusion of many doctrines, soon created a school of thought which
        acted powerfully upon the world. Four great systems of eclecticism
        arose; Aristobulus and Philo tinctured Judaism with Greek and
        Egyptian philosophy. The Gnostics and the Alexandrian fathers united,
        though in very different proportions, Christian doctrines with the
        same elements; while Neoplatonism, at least in its later forms,
        represented a fusion of the Greek and Egyptian mind. A great analogy
        was discovered between the ideal philosophy of Plato and the mystical
        philosophy that was indigenous to the East, and the two systems
        readily blended.<a id="noteref_611" name="noteref_611" href=
        "#note_611"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">611</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the most
        powerful cause of the movement was the intense desire for positive
        religious belief, which had long been growing in the Empire. The
        period when Roman incredulity reached its extreme point had been the
        century that preceded and the half century that followed the birth of
        Christ. The sudden dissolution of the old habits of the Republic
        effected through political causes, the first comparison of the
        multitudinous religions of the Empire and also the writings of
        Euhemerus had produced an absolute religious disbelief which
        Epicureanism represented and encouraged. This belief, however, as I
        have already noticed, co-existed with numerous magical and
        astrological superstitions, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page320">[pg 320]</span><a name="Pg320" id="Pg320" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the ignorance of physical science was so great,
        and the conception of general laws so faint, that the materials for a
        great revival of superstition still remained. From the middle of the
        first century, a more believing and reverent spirit began to arise.
        The worship of Isis and Serapis forced its way into Rome in spite of
        the opposition of the rulers. Apollonius of Tyana, at the close of
        the Flavian period, had endeavoured to unite moral teaching with
        religious practices; the oracles, which had long ceased, were
        partially restored under the Antonines; the calamities and visible
        decline of the Empire withdrew the minds of men from that proud
        patriotic worship of Roman greatness, which was long a substitute for
        religious feeling; and the frightful pestilence that swept over the
        land in the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his successor was followed
        by a blind, feverish, and spasmodic superstition. Besides this, men
        have never acquiesced for any considerable time in a neglect of the
        great problems of the origin, nature, and destinies of the soul, or
        dispensed with some form of religious worship and aspiration. That
        religious instincts are as truly a part of our nature as are our
        appetites and our nerves, is a fact which all history establishes,
        and which forms one of the strongest proofs of the reality of that
        unseen world to which the soul of man continually tends. Early Roman
        Stoicism, which in this respect somewhat resembled the modern
        positive school, diverted for the most part its votaries from the
        great problems of religion, and attempted to evolve its entire system
        of ethics out of existing human nature, without appealing to any
        external supernatural sanction. But the Platonic school, and the
        Egyptian school which connected itself with the name of Pythagoras,
        were both essentially religious. The first aspired to the Deity as
        the source and model of virtue, admitted dæmons or subordinate
        spiritual agents acting upon mankind, and explained and purified, in
        no hostile spirit, the popular religions. The latter made the state
        of ecstasy or quietism its <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg
        321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        ideal condition, and sought to purify the mind by theurgy or special
        religious rites. Both philosophies conspired to effect a great
        religious reformation, in which the Greek spirit usually represented
        the rational, and the Egyptian the mystical, element.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the first,
        Plutarch was the head. He taught the supreme authority of reason. He
        argued elaborately that superstition is worse than atheism, for it
        calumniates the character of the Deity, and its evils are not
        negative, but positive. At the same time, he is far from regarding
        the Mythology as a tissue of fables. Some things he denies. Others he
        explains away. Others he frankly accepts. He teaches for the most
        part a pure monotheism, which he reconciles with the common belief,
        partly by describing the different divinities as simply popular
        personifications of Divine attributes, and partly by the usual
        explanation of dæmons. He discarded most of the fables of the poets,
        applying to them with fearless severity the tests of human morality,
        and rejecting indignantly those which attribute to the Deity cruel or
        immoral actions. He denounces all religious terrorism, and draws a
        broad line of distinction between both the superstitious and
        idolatrous conception of the Deity on the one hand, and the
        philosophical conception on the other. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        superstitious man believes in the gods, but he has a false idea of
        their nature. Those good beings whose providence watches over us with
        so much care, those beings so ready to forget our faults, he
        represents as ferocious and cruel tyrants, taking pleasure in
        tormenting us. He believes the founders of brass, the sculptors of
        stone, the moulders of wax; he attributes to the gods a human form;
        he adorns and worships the image he has made, and he listens not to
        the philosophers, and men of knowledge who associate the Divine
        image, not with bodily beauty, but with grandeur and majesty, with
        gentleness and goodness.”</span><a id="noteref_612" name=

        other hand, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg
        322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Plutarch believed that there was undoubtedly a certain supernatural
        basis in the Pagan creed; he believed in oracles; he defended, in a
        very ingenious essay, hereditary punishment, and the doctrine of a
        special Providence; he admitted a future retribution, though he
        repudiated the notion of physical torment; and he brought into clear
        relief the moral teaching conveyed in some of the fables of the
        poets.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The position which
        Plutarch occupied under Trajan, Maximus of Tyre occupied in the next
        generation. Like Plutarch, but with a greater consistency, he
        maintained a pure monotheistic doctrine, declaring that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Zeus is that most ancient and guiding mind that begot
        all things—Athene is prudence—Apollo is the sun.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_613" name="noteref_613" href="#note_613"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">613</span></span></a> Like
        Plutarch, he developed the Platonic doctrine of dæmons as an
        explanation of much of the mythology, and he applied an allegorical
        interpretation with great freedom to the fables of Homer, which
        formed the text-book or the Bible of Paganism. By these means he
        endeavoured to clarify the popular creed from all elements
        inconsistent with a pure monotheism, and from all legends of doubtful
        morality, while he sublimated the popular worship into a harmless
        symbolism. <span class="tei tei-q">“The gods,”</span> he assures us,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“themselves need no images,”</span> but the
        infirmity of human nature requires visible signs <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“on which to rest.”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Those
        who possess such faculties, that with a steady mind they can rise to
        heaven, and to God, are in no need of statues. But such men are very
        rare.”</span> He then proceeds to recount the different ways by which
        men have endeavoured to represent or symbolise the Divine nature, as
        the statues of Greece, the animals of Egypt, or the sacred flame of
        Persia. <span class="tei tei-q">“The God,”</span> he continues,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Father and the Founder of all that
        exists, older than the sun, older than the sky, greater than all
        time, than every age, and than all the works of nature, whom no words
        can express, whom no eye can see.... What can we <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> say concerning his images? Only let men
        understand that there is but one Divine nature; but whether the art
        of Phidias chiefly preserves his memory among the Greeks, or the
        worship of animals among the Egyptians, a river among these, or a
        flame among those, I do not blame the variety of the
        representations—only let men understand that there is but one; only
        let them love one, let them preserve one in their

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A third writer
        who, nearly at the same time as Maximus of Tyre, made some efforts in
        the same direction, was Apuleius, who, however, both as a moral
        teacher, and in his freedom from superstition, was far inferior to
        the preceding. The religion he most admired was the Egyptian; but in
        his philosophy he was a Platonist, and in that capacity, besides an
        exposition of the Platonic code of morals, he has left us a
        singularly clear and striking disquisition on the doctrine of dæmons.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“These dæmons,”</span> he says, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“are the bearers of blessings and prayers between the
        inhabitants of earth and heaven, carrying prayers from the one and
        assistance from the other.... By them also, as Plato maintained in
        his <span class="tei tei-q">‘Banquet,’</span> all revelations, all
        the various miracles of magicians, all kinds of omens, are ruled.
        They have their several tasks to perform, their different departments
        to govern; some directing dreams, others the disposition of the
        entrails, others the flight of birds.... The supreme deities do not
        descend to these things—they leave them to the intermediate
        divinities.”</span><a id="noteref_615" name="noteref_615" href=
        "#note_615"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">615</span></span></a> But
        these intermediate spirits are not simply the agents of supernatural
        phenomena—they are also the guardians of our virtue and the recorders
        of our actions. <span class="tei tei-q">“Each man has in life
        witnesses and guards of his deeds, visible to no one, but always
        present, witnessing not only every act but every thought. When life
        has ended and we must return whence we came, the same genius who had
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324"
        id="Pg324" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> charge over us, takes us away
        and hurries us in his custody to judgment, and then assists us in
        pleading our cause. If any thing is falsely asserted he corrects
        it—if true, he substantiates it, and according to his witness our
        sentence is determined.”</span><a id="noteref_616" name="noteref_616"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are many
        aspects in which these attempts at religious reform are both
        interesting and important. They are interesting, because the doctrine
        of dæmons, mingled, it is true, with the theory of Euhemerus about
        the origin of the deities, was universally accepted by the Fathers as
        the true explanation of the Pagan theology, because the notion and,
        after the third century, even the artistic type of the guardian
        genius reappeared in that of the guardian angel, and because the
        transition from polytheism to the conception of a single deity acting
        by the delegation or ministration of an army of subsidiary spirits,
        was manifestly fitted to prepare the way for the reception of
        Christianity. They are interesting, too, as showing the anxiety of
        the human mind to sublimate its religious creed to the level of the
        moral and intellectual standard it had attained, and to make
        religious ordinances in some degree the instruments of moral
        improvement. But they are interesting above all, because the Greek
        and Egyptian methods of reform represent with typical distinctness
        the two great tendencies of religious thought in all succeeding
        periods. The Greek spirit was essentially rationalistic and eclectic;
        the Egyptian spirit was essentially mystical and devotional. The
        Greek sat in judgment upon his religion. He modified, curtailed,
        refined, allegorised, or selected. He treated its inconsistencies or
        absurdities, or immoralities, with precisely the same freedom of
        criticism as those he encountered in ordinary life. The Egyptian, on
        the other hand, bowed low before the Divine presence. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> He veiled his eyes, he humbled his
        reason, he represented the introduction of a new element into the
        moral life of Europe, the spirit of religious reverence and awe.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Egyptian deities,”</span> it was observed by
        Apuleius, <span class="tei tei-q">“were chiefly honoured by
        lamentations, and the Greek divinities by dances.”</span><a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">617</span></span></a> The
        truth of the last part of this very significant remark appears in
        every page of Greek history. No nation had a richer collection of
        games and festivals growing out of its religious system; in none did
        a light, sportive, and often licentious fancy play more fearlessly
        around the popular creed, in none was religious terrorism more rare.
        The Divinity was seldom looked upon as holier than man, and a due
        observance of certain rites and ceremonies was deemed an ample
        tribute to pay to him. In the Egyptian system the religious
        ceremonies were veiled in mystery and allegory. Chastity, abstinence
        from animal food, ablutions, long and mysterious ceremonies of
        preparation or initiation, were the most prominent features of
        worship. The deities representing the great forces of nature, and
        shrouded by mysterious symbols, excited a degree of awe which no
        other ancient religion approached.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The speculative
        philosophy, and the conceptions of morals, that accompanied the
        inroad of Oriental religions, were of a kindred nature. The most
        prominent characteristic of the first was its tendency to supersede
        the deductions of the reason by the intuitions of ecstasy.
        Neoplatonism, and the philosophies that were allied to it, were
        fundamentally pantheistic,<a id="noteref_618" name="noteref_618"
        href="#note_618"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">618</span></span></a> but
        they differed widely from the pantheism of the Stoics. The Stoics
        identified man with God, for the purpose of glorifying man—the
        Neoplatonists for the purpose of aggrandising God. In the conception
        of the first, man, independent, self-controlled, and participating in
        the highest <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page326">[pg
        326]</span><a name="Pg326" id="Pg326" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        nature of the universe, has no superior in creation. According to the
        latter, man is almost a passive being, swayed and permeated by a
        divine impulse. Yet he is not altogether divine. The divinity is
        latent in his soul, but dulled, dimmed, and crushed by the tyranny of
        the body. <span class="tei tei-q">“To bring the God that is in us
        into conformity with the God that is in the universe,”</span> to
        elicit the ideas that are graven in the mind, but obscured and hidden
        by the passions of the flesh—above all, to subdue the body, which is
        the sole obstacle to our complete fruition of the Deity—was the main
        object of life. Porphyry described all philosophy as an anticipation
        of death—not in the Stoical sense of teaching us to look calmly on
        our end, but because death realises the ideal of philosophy, the
        complete separation of soul and body. Hence followed an ascetic
        morality, and a supersensual philosophy. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        greatest of all evils,”</span> we are told, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is pleasure; because by it the soul is nailed or riveted
        to the body, and thinks that true which the body persuades it, and is
        thus deprived of the sense of divine things.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_619" name="noteref_619" href="#note_619"><span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“Justice, beauty, and goodness, and all
        things that are formed by them, no eye has ever seen, no bodily sense
        can apprehend. Philosophy must be pursued by pure and unmingled
        reason and with deadened senses; for the body disturbs the mind, so
        that it cannot follow after wisdom. As long as it is lost and mingled
        in the clay, we shall never sufficiently possess the truth we
        desire.”</span><a id="noteref_620" name="noteref_620" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the reason
        which is thus extolled as the revealer of truth must not be
        confounded with the process of reasoning. It is something quite
        different from criticism, analysis, comparison, or deduction. It is
        essentially intuitive, but it only acquires its power of
        transcendental intuition after a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page327">[pg 327]</span><a name="Pg327" id="Pg327" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> long process of discipline. When a man passes
        from the daylight into a room which is almost dark, he is at first
        absolutely unable to see the objects around him; but gradually his
        eye grows accustomed to the feeble light, the outline of the room
        becomes dimly visible, object after object emerges into sight, until
        at last, by intently gazing, he acquires the power of seeing around
        him with tolerable distinctness. In this fact we have a partial image
        of the Neoplatonic doctrine of the knowledge of divine things. Our
        soul is a dark chamber, darkened by contact with the flesh, but in it
        there are graven divine ideas, there exists a living divine element.
        The eye of reason, by long and steady introspection, can learn to
        decipher these characters; the will, aided by an appointed course of
        discipline, can evoke this divine element, and cause it to blend with
        the universal spirit from which it sprang. The powers of mental
        concentration, and of metaphysical abstraction, are therefore the
        highest intellectual gifts; and quietism, or the absorption of our
        nature in God, is the last stage of virtue. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The end of man,”</span> said Pythagoras, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“is God.”</span> The mysterious 'One,' the metaphysical
        abstraction without attributes and without form which constitutes the
        First Person of the Alexandrian Trinity, is the acme of human
        thought, and the condition of ecstasy is the acme of moral
        perfection. Plotinus, it was said, had several times attained it.
        Porphyry, after years of discipline, once, and but once.<a id=

        divine things the task of man is not to create or to acquire, but to
        educe. His means of perfection are not dialectics or research, but
        long and patient meditation, silence, abstinence from the
        distractions and occupations of life, the subjugation of the flesh, a
        life of continual discipline, a constant attendance on those
        mysterious rites which detach <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The system of
        Neoplatonism represents a mode of thought which in many forms, and
        under many names, may be traced through the most various ages and
        creeds. Mysticism, transcendentalism, inspiration, and grace, are all
        words expressing the deep-seated belief that we possess fountains of
        knowledge apart from all the acquisitions of the senses; that there
        are certain states of mind, certain flashes of moral and intellectual
        illumination, which cannot be accounted for by any play or
        combination of our ordinary faculties. For the sobriety, the
        timidity, the fluctuations of the reasoning spirit, Neoplatonism
        substituted the transports of the imagination; and, though it
        cultivated the power of abstraction, every other intellectual gift
        was sacrificed to the discipline of asceticism. It made men
        credulous, because it suppressed that critical spirit which is the
        sole barrier to the ever-encroaching imagination; because it
        represented superstitious rites as especially conducive to that state
        of ecstasy which was the condition of revelation; because it formed a
        nervous, diseased, expectant temperament, ever prone to
        hallucinations, ever agitated by vague and uncertain feelings that
        were readily attributed to inspiration. As a moral system it carried,
        indeed, the purification of the feelings and imagination to a higher
        perfection than any preceding school, but it had the deadly fault of
        separating sentiment from action. In this respect it was well fitted
        to be the close, the final suicide, of Roman philosophy. Cicero
        assigned a place of happiness in the future world to all who
        faithfully served the State.<a id="noteref_624" name="noteref_624"
        href="#note_624"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">624</span></span></a> The
        Stoics had taught that all virtue was vain that did not issue in
        action. Even Epictetus, in his portrait of the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg 329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> ascetic cynic—even Marcus Aurelius, in
        his minute self-examination—had never forgotten the outer world. The
        early Platonists, though they dwelt very strongly on mental
        discipline, were equally practical. Plutarch reminds us that the same
        word is used for light, and for man,<a id="noteref_625" name=
        "noteref_625" href="#note_625"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">625</span></span></a> for the
        duty of man is to be the light of the world; and he shrewdly remarked
        that Hesiod exhorted the husbandman to pray for the harvest, but to
        do so with his hand upon the plough. Apuleius, expounding Plato,
        taught <span class="tei tei-q">“that he who is inspired by nature to
        seek after good must not deem himself born for himself alone, but for
        all mankind, though with diverse kinds and degrees of obligation, for
        he is formed first of all for his country, then for his relations,
        then for those with whom he is joined by occupation or
        knowledge.”</span> Maximus of Tyre devoted two noble essays to
        showing the vanity of all virtue which exhausts itself in mental
        transports without radiating in action among mankind. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“What use,”</span> he asked, <span class="tei tei-q">“is
        there in knowledge unless we do those things for which knowledge is
        profitable? What use is there in the skill of the physician unless by
        that skill he heals the sick, or in the art of Phidias unless he
        chisels the ivory or the gold.... Hercules was a wise man, but not
        for himself, but that by his wisdom he might diffuse benefits over
        every land and sea.... Had he preferred to lead a life apart from
        men, and to follow an idle wisdom, Hercules would indeed have been a
        Sophist, and no one would call him the son of Zeus. For God himself
        is never idle; were He to rest, the sky would cease to move, and the
        earth to produce, and the rivers to flow into the ocean, and the
        seasons to pursue their appointed course.”</span><a id="noteref_626"

        Neoplatonists, though they sometimes spoke of civic <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> virtues, regarded the condition of
        ecstasy as not only transcending, but including all, and that
        condition could only be arrived at by a passive life. The saying of
        Anaxagoras, that his mission was <span class="tei tei-q">“to
        contemplate the sun, the stars, and the course of nature, and that
        this contemplation was wisdom,”</span> was accepted as an epitome of
        their philosophy.<a id="noteref_627" name="noteref_627" href=

        senator named Rogantianus, who had followed the teaching of Plotinus,
        acquired so intense a disgust for the things of life, that he left
        all his property, refused to fulfil the duties of a prætor, abandoned
        his senatorial functions, and withdrew himself from every form of
        business and pleasure. Plotinus, instead of reproaching him,
        overwhelmed him with eulogy, selected him as his favourite disciple,
        and continually represented him as the model of a philosopher.<a id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The two
        characteristics I have noticed—the abandonment of civic duties, and
        the discouragement of the critical spirit—had from a very early

        blending philosophies of the third and fourth centuries, they became
        continually more apparent. Plotinus was still an independent
        philosopher, inheriting the traditions of Greek thought, though not
        the traditions of Greek life, building his system avowedly by a
        rational method, and altogether rejecting theurgy or religious magic.
        His disciple, Porphyry, first made Neoplatonism anti-Christian, and,
        in his violent antipathy to the new faith, began to convert it into a
        religious system. Iamblichus, who was himself an Egyptian priest,
        completed the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg

        transformation,<a id="noteref_630" name="noteref_630" href=

        resolved all moral discipline into theurgy, and sacrificed all
        reasoning to faith.<a id="noteref_631" name="noteref_631" href=
        "#note_631"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        attempted to realise the conception of a revived Paganism, blending
        with and purified by philosophy. In every form the appetite for
        miracles and for belief was displayed. The theory of dæmons
        completely superseded the old Stoical naturalism, which regarded the
        different Pagan divinities as allegories or personifications of the
        Divine attributes. The Platonic ethics were again, for the most part,
        in the ascendant, but they were deeply tinctured by a foreign
        element. Thus, suicide was condemned by the Neoplatonists, not merely
        on the principle of Plato, that it is an abandonment of the post of
        duty to which the Deity has called us, but also on the quietist
        ground, that perturbation is necessarily a pollution of the soul, and
        that, as mental perturbation accompanies the act, the soul of the
        suicide departs polluted from the body.<a id="noteref_632" name=

        belief in a future world, which was the common glory of the schools
        of Pythagoras and of Plato, had become universal. As Roman greatness,
        in which men had long seen the reward of virtue, faded rapidly away,
        the conception of <span class="tei tei-q">“a city of God”</span>
        began to grow more clearly in the minds of men, and the countless
        slaves who were among the chief propagators of Oriental faiths, and
        who had begun to exercise an unprecedented influence in Roman life,
        turned with a natural and a touching eagerness towards a happier and

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> disappeared. Above all, a fusion had been
        effected between moral discipline and religion, and the moralist
        sought his chief means of purification in the ceremonies of the
        temple.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have now
        completed the long and complicated task to which the present chapter
        has been devoted. I have endeavoured to exhibit, so far as can be
        done, by a description of general tendencies, and by a selection of
        quotations, the spirit of the long series of Pagan moralists who
        taught at Rome during the period that elapsed between the rise of
        Roman philosophy and the triumph of Christianity. My object has not
        been to classify these writers with minute accuracy, according to
        their speculative tenets, but rather, as I had proposed, to exhibit
        the origin, the nature, and the fortunes of the general notion or
        type of virtue which each moralist had regarded as supremely good.
        History is not a mere succession of events connected only by
        chronology. It is a chain of causes and effects. There is a great
        natural difference of degree and direction in both the moral and
        intellectual capacities of individuals, but it is not probable that
        the general average of natural morals in great bodies of men
        materially varies. When we find a society very virtuous or very
        vicious—when some particular virtue or vice occupies a peculiar
        prominence, or when important changes pass over the moral conceptions
        or standard of the people—we have to trace in these things simply the
        action of the circumstances that were dominant. The history of Roman
        ethics represents a steady and uniform current, guided by the general
        conditions of society, and its progress may be marked by the
        successive ascendancy of the Roman, the Greek, and the Egyptian
        spirit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the age of Cato
        and Cicero the character of the ideal was wholly Roman, although the
        philosophical expression of that character was derived from the Greek
        Stoics. It exhibited all the force, the grandeur, the hardness, the
        practical tendency which Roman circumstances had early created,
        combined with that catholicity of spirit which resulted from very
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333"
        id="Pg333" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> recent political and
        intellectual changes. In the course of time, the Greek element, which
        represented the gentler and more humane spirit of antiquity, gained
        an ascendancy. It did so by simple propagandism, aided by the long
        peace of the Antonines, by the effeminate habits produced by the
        increasing luxury, by the attractions of the metropolis, which had
        drawn multitudes of Greeks to Rome, by the patronage of the Emperors,
        and also by the increasing realisation of the doctrine of universal
        brotherhood, which Panætius and Cicero had asserted, but of which the
        full consequences were only perceived by their successors. The change
        in the type of virtue was shown in the influence of eclectic, and for
        the most part Platonic, moralists, whose special assaults were
        directed against the Stoical condemnation of the emotions, and in the
        gradual softening of the Stoical type. In Seneca the hardness of the
        sect, though very apparent, is broken by precepts of a real and
        extensive benevolence, though that benevolence springs rather from a
        sense of duty than from tenderness of feeling. In Dion Chrysostom the
        practical benevolence is not less prominent, but there is less both
        of pride and of callousness. Epictetus embodied the sternest Stoicism
        in his Manual, but his dissertations exhibit a deep religious feeling
        and a wide range of sympathies. In Marcus Aurelius the emotional
        elements had greatly increased, and the amiable qualities began to
        predominate over the heroic ones. We find at the same time a new
        stress laid upon purity of thought and imagination, a growing feeling
        of reverence, and an earnest desire to reform the popular
        religion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This second stage
        exhibits a happy combination of the Roman and Greek spirits.
        Disinterested, strictly practical, averse to the speculative
        subtilties of the Greek intellect, Stoicism was still the religion of
        a people who were the rulers and the organisers of the world, whose
        enthusiasm was essentially patriotic, and who had learnt to sacrifice
        everything but pride to the sense of duty. It had, however, become
        amiable, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg
        334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        gentle, and spiritual. It had gained much in beauty, while it had
        lost something in force. In the world of morals, as in the world of
        physics, strength is nearly allied to hardness. He who feels keenly
        is easily moved, and a sensitive sympathy which lies at the root of
        an amiable character is in consequence a principle of weakness. The
        race of great Roman Stoics, which had never ceased during the tyranny
        of Nero or Domitian, began to fail. In the very moment when the ideal
        of the sect had attained its supreme perfection, a new movement
        appeared, the philosophy sank into disrepute, and the last act of the
        drama began.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this, as in the
        preceding ones, all was normal and regular. The long continuance of
        despotic government had gradually destroyed the active public spirit
        of which Stoicism was the expression. The predominance of the subtle
        intellect of Greece, and the multiplication of rhetoricians, had
        converted the philosophy into a school of disputation and of
        casuistry. The increasing cultivation of the emotions continued, till
        what may be termed the moral centre was changed, and the development
        of feeling was deemed more important than the regulation of actions.
        This cultivation of the emotions predisposed men to religion. A
        reaction, intensified by many minor causes, set in against the
        scepticism of the preceding generation, and Alexandria gradually
        became the moral capital of the empire. The Roman type speedily
        disappeared. A union was effected between superstitious rites and
        philosophy, and the worship of Egyptian deities prepared the way for
        the teaching of the Neoplatonists, who combined the most visionary
        part of the speculations of Plato with the ancient philosophies of
        the East. In Plotinus we find most of the first; in Iamblichus most
        of the second. The minds of men, under their influence, grew
        introspective, credulous, and superstitious, and found their ideal
        states in the hallucinations of ecstasy and the calm of an
        unpractical mysticism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such were the
        influences which acted in turn upon a society which, by despotism, by
        slavery, and by atrocious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg
        335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        amusements, had been debased and corrupted to the very core. Each
        sect which successively arose contributed something to remedy the
        evil. Stoicism placed beyond cavil the great distinctions between
        right and wrong. It inculcated the doctrine of universal brotherhood,
        it created a noble literature and a noble legislation, and it
        associated its moral system with the patriotic spirit which was then
        the animating spirit of Roman life. The early Platonists of the
        Empire corrected the exaggerations of Stoicism, gave free scope to
        the amiable qualities, and supplied a theory of right and wrong,
        suited not merely for heroic characters and for extreme emergencies,
        but also for the characters and the circumstances of common life. The
        Pythagorean and Neoplatonic schools revived the feeling of religious
        reverence, inculcated humility, prayerfulness, and purity of thought,
        and accustomed men to associate their moral ideals with the Deity,
        rather than with themselves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The moral
        improvement of society was now to pass into other hands. A religion
        which had long been increasing in obscurity began to emerge into the
        light. By the beauty of its moral precepts, by the systematic skill
        with which it governed the imagination and habits of its worshippers,
        by the strong religious motives to which it could appeal, by its
        admirable ecclesiastical organisation, and, it must be added, by its
        unsparing use of the arm of power, Christianity soon eclipsed or
        destroyed all other sects, and became for many centuries the supreme
        ruler of the moral world. Combining the Stoical doctrine of universal
        brotherhood, the Greek predilection for the amiable qualities, and
        the Egyptian spirit of reverence and religious awe, it acquired from
        the first an intensity and universality of influence which none of
        the philosophies it had superseded had approached. I have now to
        examine the moral causes that governed the rise of this religion in
        Rome, the ideal of virtue it presented, the degree and manner in
        which it stamped its image upon the character of nations, and the
        perversions and distortions it underwent.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no fact
        in the history of the human mind more remarkable than the complete
        unconsciousness of the importance and the destinies of Christianity,
        manifested by the Pagan writers before the accession of Constantine.
        So large an amount of attention has been bestowed on the ten or
        twelve allusions to it they furnish, that we are sometimes apt to
        forget how few and meagre those allusions are, and how utterly
        impossible it is to construct from them, with any degree of
        certainty, a history of the early Church. Plutarch and the elder
        Pliny, who probably surpass all other writers of their time in the
        range of their illustrations, and Seneca, who was certainly the most
        illustrious moralist of his age, never even mention it. Epictetus and
        Marcus Aurelius have each adverted to it with a passing and
        contemptuous censure. Tacitus describes in detail the persecution by
        Nero, but treats the suffering religion merely as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“an execrable superstition;”</span> while Suetonius,
        employing the same expression, reckons the persecution among the acts
        of the tyrant that were either laudable or indifferent. Our most
        important document is the famous letter of the younger Pliny. Lucian
        throws some light both on the extent of Christian charity, and on the
        aspect in which Christians were regarded by the religious jugglers of
        their age, and the long series of Pagans who wrote the lives of the
        Emperors in that most critical period from the accession of Hadrian,
        almost to the eve of the triumph of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page337">[pg 337]</span><a name="Pg337" id="Pg337" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the Church, among a crowd of details concerning
        the dresses, games, vices, and follies of the Court, supply us with
        six or seven short notices of the religion that was transforming the
        world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
        silence of the Pagan writers on this subject did not arise from any
        restrictions imposed upon them by authority, for in this field the
        widest latitude was conceded, nor yet from the notions of the dignity
        of history, or the importance of individual exertions, which have
        induced some historians to resolve their task into a catalogue of the
        achievements of kings, statesmen, and generals. The conception of
        history, as the record and explanation of moral revolutions, though
        of course not developed to the same prominence as among some modern
        writers, was by no means unknown in antiquity,<a id="noteref_634"
        name="noteref_634" href="#note_634"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">634</span></span></a> and in
        many branches our knowledge of the social changes of the Roman Empire
        is extremely copious. The dissolution of old beliefs, the
        decomposition of the entire social and moral system that had arisen
        under the Republic, engaged in the very highest degree the attention
        of the literary classes, and they displayed the most commendable
        diligence in tracing its stages. It is very curious and instructive
        to contrast the ample information they have furnished us concerning
        the growth of Roman luxury, with their almost absolute silence
        concerning the growth of Christianity. The moral importance of the
        former movement they clearly recognised, and they have accordingly
        preserved so full a record of all the changes in dress, banquets,
        buildings, and spectacles, that it would be possible to write with
        the most minute detail the whole history of Roman luxury, from the
        day when a censor deprived an elector of his vote because his garden
        was negligently <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg
        338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        cultivated, to the orgies of Nero or Heliogabalus. The moral
        importance of the other movement they altogether overlooked, and
        their oversight leaves a chasm in history which can never be
        supplied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the greatest
        religious change in the history of mankind should have taken place
        under the eyes of a brilliant galaxy of philosophers and historians,
        who were profoundly conscious of the decomposition around them, that
        all of these writers should have utterly failed to predict the issue
        of the movement they were observing, and that, during the space of
        three centuries, they should have treated as simply contemptible an
        agency which all men must now admit to have been, for good or for
        evil, the most powerful moral lever that has ever been applied to the
        affairs of man, are facts well worthy of meditation in every period
        of religious transition. The explanation is to be found in that broad
        separation between the spheres of morals and of positive religion we
        have considered in the last chapter. In modern times, men who were
        examining the probable moral future of the world, would naturally,
        and in the first place, direct their attention to the relative
        positions and the probable destinies of religious institutions. In
        the Stoical period of the Roman Empire, positive religion had come to
        be regarded as merely an art for obtaining preternatural assistance
        in the affairs of life, and the moral amelioration of mankind was
        deemed altogether external to its sphere. Philosophy had become to
        the educated most literally a religion. It was the rule of life, the
        exposition of the Divine nature, the source of devotional feeling.
        The numerous Oriental superstitions that had deluged the city were
        regarded as peculiarly pernicious and contemptible, and of these none
        was less likely to attract the favour of the philosophers than that
        of the Jews,<a id="noteref_635" name="noteref_635" href=
        "#note_635"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        were notorious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
        339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> as
        the most sordid, the most turbulent,<a id="noteref_636" name=

        Oriental colonists. Of the ignorance of their tenets, displayed even
        by the most eminent Romans, we have a striking illustration in the
        long series of grotesque fables concerning their belief, probably
        derived from some satirical pamphlet, which Tacitus has gravely
        inserted in his history.<a id="noteref_638" name="noteref_638" href=

        Christianity, in the eyes of the philosopher, was simply a sect of
        Judaism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although I am
        anxious in the present work to avoid, as far as possible, all
        questions that are purely theological, and to consider Christianity
        merely in its aspect as a moral agent, it will be necessary to bestow
        a few preliminary pages upon its triumph in the Roman Empire, in
        order to ascertain how far that triumph was due to moral causes, and
        what were its relations to the prevailing philosophy. There are some
        writers who have been so struck with the conformity between some of
        the doctrines of the later Stoics and those of Christianity that they
        have imagined that Christianity had early obtained a decisive
        influence over philosophy, and that the leading teachers of Rome had
        been in some measure its disciples. There are others who reduce the
        conversion of the Roman Empire to a mere question of evidences, to
        the overwhelming proofs the Christian teachers produced of the
        authenticity of the Gospel narratives. There are others, again, who
        deem the triumph of Christianity simply miraculous. Everything, they
        tell us, was against it. The course of the Church was like that of a
        ship sailing rapidly and steadily to the goal, in direct defiance of
        both wind and tide, and the conversion of the Empire was as literally
        supernatural as the raising of the dead, or the sudden quelling of
        the storm.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the first of
        these theories it will not, I think, be <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340" id="Pg340" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> necessary, after the last chapter, to expatiate
        at length. It is admitted that the greatest moralists of the Roman
        Empire either never mentioned Christianity, or mentioned it with
        contempt; that they habitually disregarded the many religions which
        had arisen among the ignorant; and that we have no direct evidence of
        the slightest value of their ever having come in contact with or
        favoured the Christians. The supposition that they were influenced by
        Christianity rests mainly upon their enforcement of the Christian
        duty of self-examination, upon their strong assertion of the
        universal brotherhood of mankind, and upon the delicate and expansive
        humanity they at last evinced. But although on all these points the
        later Stoics approximated much to Christianity, we have already seen
        that it is easy to discover in each case the cause of the tendency.
        The duty of self-examination was simply a Pythagorean precept,
        enforced in that school long before the rise of Christianity,
        introduced into Stoicism when Pythagoreanism became popular in Rome,
        and confessedly borrowed from this source. The doctrine of the
        universal brotherhood of mankind was the manifest expression of those
        political and social changes which reduced the whole civilised globe
        to one great empire, threw open to the most distant tribes the right
        of Roman citizenship, and subverted all those class divisions around
        which moral theories had been formed. Cicero asserted it as
        emphatically as Seneca. The theory of pantheism, representing the
        entire creation as one great body, pervaded by one Divine soul,
        harmonised with it; and it is a curious fact that the very
        phraseology concerning the fellow-membership of all things in God,
        which has been most confidently adduced by some modern writers as
        proving the connection between Seneca and Christianity, was selected
        by Lactantius as the clearest illustration of the pantheism of
        Stoicism.<a id="noteref_639" name="noteref_639" href=
        "#note_639"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        humane character of the later Stoical teaching <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page341">[pg 341]</span><a name="Pg341" id="Pg341"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was obviously due to the infusion of the
        Greek element into Roman life, which began before the foundation of
        the Empire, and received a new impulse in the reign of Hadrian, and
        also to the softening influence of a luxurious civilisation, and of
        the long peace of the Antonines. While far inferior to the Greeks in
        practical and realised humanity, the Romans never surpassed their
        masters in theoretical humanity except in one respect. The humanity
        of the Greeks, though very earnest, was confined within a narrow
        circle. The social and political circumstances of the Roman Empire
        destroyed the barrier.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only case in
        which any plausible arguments have been urged in favour of the notion
        that the writings of the Stoics were influenced by the New Testament
        is that of Seneca. This philosopher was regarded by all the mediæval
        writers as a Christian, on the ground of a correspondence with St.
        Paul, which formed part of a forged account of the martyrdom of St.
        Peter and St. Paul, attributed to St. Linus. These letters, which
        were absolutely unnoticed during the first three centuries, and are
        first mentioned by St. Jerome, are now almost universally abandoned
        as forgeries;<a id="noteref_640" name="noteref_640" href=
        "#note_640"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">640</span></span></a> but
        many curious coincidences of phraseology have been pointed out
        between the writings of Seneca and the epistles of St. Paul; and the
        presumption derived from them has been strengthened by the facts that
        the brother of Seneca was that Gallio who refused to hear the
        disputes between St. Paul and the Jews, and that Burrhus, who was the
        friend and colleague of Seneca, was the officer to whose custody St.

        not necessary for me to enter. It has been shown that much of what
        was deemed Christian phraseology grew out of the pantheistic notion
        of one great body including, and one Divine mind animating and
        guiding, all existing things; and many other of the pretended
        coincidences are so slight as to be altogether worthless as an
        argument. Still I think most persons who review what has been written
        on the subject will conclude that it is probable some fragments at
        least of Christian language had come to the ears of Seneca. But to
        suppose that his system of morals is in any degree formed after the
        model or under the influence of Christianity, is to be blind to the
        most obvious characteristics of both Christianity and Stoicism; for
        no other moralist could be so aptly selected as representing their
        extreme divergence. Reverence and humility, a constant sense of the
        supreme majesty of God and of the weakness and sinfulness of man, and
        a perpetual reference to another world, were the essential
        characteristics of Christianity, the source of all its power, the
        basis of its distinctive type. Of all these, the teaching of Seneca
        is the direct antithesis. Careless of the future world, and
        profoundly convinced of the supreme majesty of man, he laboured to
        emancipate his disciples <span class="tei tei-q">“from every fear of
        God and man;”</span> and the proud language in which he claimed for
        the sage an equality with the gods represents, perhaps, the highest
        point to which philosophic arrogance has been carried. The Jews, with
        whom the Christians were then universally identified, he emphatically
        describes as <span class="tei tei-q">“an accursed race.”</span><a id=

        among the later Stoics who had almost realised the Christian type,
        and in whose pure and gentle nature the arrogance of his school can
        be scarcely traced; but Marcus Aurelius, who of all the Pagan world,
        if we argued by internal evidence alone, would have been most readily
        identified with Christianity, was a persecutor of the faith, and he
        has left on record in his <span class=

        they designated the writings of the philosophers as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the schools of heretics,”</span> and collected with a
        malicious assiduity all the calumnies that had been heaped upon their
        memory—there were others who made it a leading object to establish a
        close affinity between Pagan philosophy and the Christian revelation.
        Imbued in many instances, almost from childhood, with the noble
        teaching of Plato, and keenly alive to the analogies between his
        philosophy and their new faith, these writers found the exhibition of
        this resemblance at once deeply grateful to themselves and the most
        successful way of dispelling the prejudices of their Pagan
        neighbours. The success that had attended the Christian prophecies
        attributed to the Sibyls and the oracles, the passion for
        eclecticism, which the social and commercial position of Alexandria
        had generated, and also the example of the Jew Aristobulus, who had
        some time before contended that the Jewish <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> writings had been translated into Greek, and
        had been the source of much of the Pagan wisdom, encouraged them in
        their course. The most conciliatory, and at the same time the most
        philosophical school, was the earliest in the Church. Justin
        Martyr—the first of the Fathers whose writings possess any general
        philosophical interest—cordially recognises the excellence of many
        parts of the Pagan philosophy, and even attributes it to a Divine
        inspiration, to the action of the generative or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“seminal Logos,”</span> which from the earliest times had
        existed in the world, had inspired teachers like Socrates and
        Musonius, who had been persecuted by the dæmons, and had received in
        Christianity its final and perfect manifestation.<a id="noteref_647"
        name="noteref_647" href="#note_647"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">647</span></span></a> The
        same generous and expansive appreciation may be traced in the
        writings of several later Fathers, although the school was speedily
        disfigured by some grotesque extravagances. Clement of Alexandria—a
        writer of wide sympathies, considerable originality, very extensive
        learning, but of a feeble and fantastic judgment—who immediately
        succeeded Justin Martyr, attributed all the wisdom of antiquity to
        two sources. The first source was tradition; for the angels, who had
        been fascinated by the antediluvian ladies, had endeavoured to
        ingratiate themselves with their fair companions by giving them an
        abstract of the metaphysical and other learning which was then
        current in heaven, and the substance of these conversations, being
        transmitted by tradition, supplied the Pagan philosophers with their
        leading notions. The angels did not know everything, and therefore
        the Greek philosophy was imperfect; but this event formed the first
        great epoch in literary history. The second and most important source
        of Pagan wisdom was the Old Testament,<a id="noteref_648" name=
        "noteref_648" href="#note_648"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">648</span></span></a> the
        influence of which many of the early Christians traced in every
        department of ancient wisdom. Plato had <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page345">[pg 345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> borrowed from it all his philosophy, Homer the
        noblest conceptions of his poetry, Demosthenes the finest touches of
        his eloquence. Even Miltiades owed his military skill to an assiduous
        study of the Pentateuch, and the ambuscade by which he won the battle
        of Marathon was imitated from the strategy of Moses.<a id=

        Pythagoras, moreover, had been himself a circumcised Jew.<a id=

        had been instructed in Egypt by the prophet Jeremiah. The god Serapis
        was no other than the patriarch Joseph, his Egyptian name being
        manifestly derived from his great-grandmother Sarah.<a id=
        "noteref_651" name="noteref_651" href="#note_651"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Absurdities of
        this kind, of which I have given extreme but by no means the only
        examples, were usually primarily intended to repel arguments against
        Christianity, and they are illustrations of the tendency which has
        always existed in an uncritical age to invent, without a shadow of
        foundation, the most elaborate theories of explanation rather than
        recognise the smallest force in an objection. Thus, when the Pagans
        attempted to reduce Christianity to a normal product of the human
        mind, by pointing to the very numerous Pagan legends which were
        precisely parallel to the Jewish histories, <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> it was answered that the dæmons were careful
        students of prophecy, that they foresaw with terror the advent of
        their Divine Conqueror, and that, in order to prevent men believing
        in him, they had invented, by anticipation, a series of legends
        resembling the events which were foretold.<a id="noteref_652" name=
        "noteref_652" href="#note_652"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">652</span></span></a> More
        frequently, however, the early Christians retorted the accusations of
        plagiarism, and by forged writings attributed to Pagan authors, or,
        by pointing out alleged traces of Jewish influence in genuine Pagan
        writings, they endeavoured to trace through the past the footsteps of
        their faith. But this method of assimilation, which culminated in the
        Gnostics, the Neoplatonists, and especially in Origen, was directed
        not to the later Stoics of the Empire, but to the great philosophers
        who had preceded Christianity. It was in the writings of Plato, not
        in those of Epictetus or Marcus Aurelius, that the Fathers of the
        first three centuries found the influence of the Jewish Scriptures,
        and at the time when the passion for discovering these connections
        was most extravagant, the notion of Seneca and his followers being
        inspired by the Christians was unknown.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dismissing then,
        as altogether groundless, the notion that Christianity had obtained a
        complete or even a partial influence over the philosophic classes
        during the period of Stoical ascendancy, we come to the opinion of
        those who suppose that the Roman Empire was converted by a system of
        evidences—by the miraculous proofs of the divinity of Christianity,
        submitted to the adjudication of the people. To estimate this view
        aright, we have to consider both the capacity of the men of that age
        for judging miracles, and also—which is a different question—the
        extent to which such evidence would weigh upon their minds. To treat
        this subject satisfactorily, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page347">[pg 347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> it may be advisable to enter at some little
        length into the broad question of the evidence of the miraculous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the exception
        of a small minority of the priests of the Catholic Church, a general
        incredulity on the subject of miracles now underlies the opinions of
        almost all educated men. Nearly every one, however cordially he may
        admit some one particular class of miracles, as a general rule
        regards the accounts of such events, which are so frequent in all old
        historians, as false and incredible, even when he fully believes the
        natural events that are authenticated by the same testimony. The
        reason of this incredulity is not altogether the impossibility or
        even extreme natural improbability of miracles; for, whatever may be
        the case with some, there is at least one class or conception of them
        which is perfectly free from logical difficulty. There is no
        contradiction involved in the belief that spiritual beings, of power
        and wisdom immeasurably transcending our own, exist, or that,
        existing, they might, by the normal exercise of their powers, perform
        feats as far surpassing the understanding of the most gifted of
        mankind, as the electric telegraph and the prediction of an eclipse
        surpass the faculties of a savage. Nor does the incredulity arise, I
        think, as is commonly asserted, from the want of that amount and kind
        of evidence which in other departments is deemed sufficient. Very few
        of the minor facts of history are authenticated by as much evidence
        as the Stigmata of St. Francis, or the miracle of the holy thorn, or
        those which were said to have been wrought at the tomb of the Abbé
        Paris. We believe, with tolerable assurance, a crowd of historical
        events on the testimony of one or two Roman historians; but when
        Tacitus and Suetonius describe how Vespasian restored a blind man to
        sight, and a cripple to strength,<a id="noteref_653" name=
        "noteref_653" href="#note_653"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">653</span></span></a> their
        deliberate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg
        348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        assertions do not even beget in our minds a suspicion that the
        narrative may possibly be true. We are quite certain that miracles
        were not ordinary occurrences in classical or mediæval times, but
        nearly all the contemporary writers from whom we derive our knowledge
        of those periods were convinced that they were.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, then, I have
        correctly interpreted the opinions of ordinary educated people on
        this subject, it appears that the common attitude towards miracles is
        not that of doubt, of hesitation, of discontent with the existing
        evidence, but rather of absolute, derisive, and even unexamining
        incredulity. Such a fact, when we consider that the antecedent
        possibility of at least some miracles is usually admitted, and in the
        face of the vast mass of tradition that may be adduced in their
        favour, appears at first sight a striking anomaly, and the more so
        because it can be shown that the belief in miracles had in most cases
        not been reasoned down, but had simply faded away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In order to
        ascertain the process by which this state of mind has been attained,
        we may take an example in a sphere which is happily removed from
        controversy. There are very few persons with whom the fictitious
        character of fairy tales has not ceased to be a question, or who
        would hesitate to disbelieve or even to ridicule any anecdote of this
        nature which was told them, without the very smallest examination of
        its evidence. Yet, if we ask in what respect the existence of fairies
        is naturally contradictory or absurd, it would be difficult to answer
        the question. A fairy is simply a being <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page349">[pg 349]</span><a name="Pg349" id="Pg349" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> possessing a moderate share of human
        intelligence, with little or no moral faculty, with a body pellucid,
        winged, and volatile, like that of an insect, with a passion for
        dancing, and, perhaps, with an extraordinary knowledge of the
        properties of different plants. That such beings should exist, or
        that, existing, they should be able to do many things beyond human
        power, are propositions which do not present the smallest difficulty.
        For many centuries their existence was almost universally believed.
        There is not a country, not a province, scarcely a parish, in which
        traditions of their appearance were not long preserved. So great a
        weight of tradition, so many independent trains of evidence attesting
        statements perfectly free from intrinsic absurdity, or even
        improbability, might appear sufficient, if not to establish
        conviction, at least to supply a very strong <span lang="la" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="la"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">primâ facie</span></span> case, and ensure a
        patient and respectful investigation of the subject.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has not done
        so, and the reason is sufficiently plain. The question of the
        credibility of fairy tales has not been resolved by an examination of
        evidence, but by an observation of the laws of historic development.
        Wherever we find an ignorant and rustic population, the belief in
        fairies is found to exist, and circumstantial accounts of their
        apparitions are circulated. But invariably with increased education
        this belief passes away. It is not that the fairy tales are refuted
        or explained away, or even narrowly scrutinised. It is that the
        fairies cease to appear. From the uniformity of this decline, we
        infer that fairy tales are the normal product of a certain condition
        of the imagination; and this position is raised to a moral certainty
        when we find that the decadence of fairy tales is but one of a long
        series of similar transformations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the savage
        looks around upon the world and begins to form his theories of
        existence, he falls at once into three great errors, which become the
        first principles of his subsequent <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page350">[pg 350]</span><a name="Pg350" id="Pg350" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> opinions. He believes that this earth is the
        centre of the universe, and that all the bodies encircling it are
        intended for its use; that the disturbances and dislocations it
        presents, and especially the master curse of death, are connected
        with some event in his history, and also that the numerous phenomena
        and natural vicissitudes he sees around him are due to direct and
        isolated volitions, either of spirits presiding over, or of
        intelligences inherent in, matter. Around these leading conceptions a
        crowd of particular legends speedily cluster. If a stone falls beside
        him, he naturally infers that some one has thrown it. If it be an
        aërolite, it is attributed to some celestial being. Believing that
        each comet, tempest, or pestilence results from a direct and isolated
        act, he proceeds to make theories regarding the motives that have
        induced his spiritual persecutors to assail him, and the methods by
        which he may assuage their anger. Finding numerous distinct trains or
        series of phenomena, he invents for each appropriate presiding
        spirits. Miracles are to him neither strange events nor violations of
        natural law, but simply the unveiling or manifestation of the
        ordinary government of the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With these broad
        intellectual conceptions several minor influences concur. A latent
        fetichism, which is betrayed in that love of direct personification,
        or of applying epithets derived from sentient beings to inanimate
        nature, which appears so largely in all poetry and eloquence, and
        especially in those of an early period of society, is the root of a
        great part of our opinions. If—to employ a very familiar
        illustration—the most civilised and rational of mankind will observe
        his own emotions, when by some accident he has struck his head
        violently against a door-post, he will probably find that his first
        exclamation was not merely of pain but of anger, and of anger
        directed against the wood. In a moment reason checks the emotion; but
        if he observes carefully his own feelings, he may easily convince
        himself of the unconscious <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg
        351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        fetichism which, is latent in his mind, and which, in the case of a
        child or a savage, displays itself without reserve. Man instinctively
        ascribes volition to whatever powerfully affects him. The feebleness
        of his imagination conspires with other causes to prevent an
        uncivilised man from rising above the conception of an
        anthropomorphic Deity, and the capricious or isolated acts of such a
        being form his exact notion of miracles. The same feebleness of
        imagination makes him clothe all intellectual tendencies, all
        conflicting emotions, all forces, passions, or fancies, in material
        forms. His mind naturally translates the conflict between opposing
        feelings into a history of the combat between rival spirits. A vast
        accumulation of myths is spontaneously formed—each legend being
        merely the material expression of a moral fact. The simple love of
        the wonderful, and the complete absence of all critical spirit, aid
        the formation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this manner we
        find that in certain stages of society, and under the action of the
        influences I have stated, an accretion of miraculous legends is
        naturally formed around prominent personages or institutions. We look
        for them as we look for showers in April, or for harvest in autumn.
        We can very rarely show with any confidence the precise manner in
        which a particular legend is created or the nucleus of truth it
        contains, but we can analyse the general causes that have impelled
        men towards the miraculous; we can show that these causes have never
        failed to produce the effect, and we can trace the gradual alteration
        of mental conditions invariably accompanying the decline of the
        belief. When men are destitute of critical spirit, when the notion of
        uniform law is yet unborn, and when their imaginations are still
        incapable of rising to abstract ideas, histories of miracles are
        always formed and always believed, and they continue to flourish and
        to multiply until these conditions have altered. Miracles cease when
        men cease to believe and to expect them. In periods that are equally
        credulous, they multiply or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg
        352]</span><a name="Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        diminish in proportion to the intensity with which the imagination is
        directed to theological topics. A comparison of the histories of the
        most different nations shows the mythical period to have been common
        to all; and we may trace in many quarters substantially the same
        miracles, though varied by national characteristics, and with a
        certain local cast and colouring. As among the Alps the same shower
        falls as rain in the sunny valleys, and as snow among the lofty
        peaks, so the same intellectual conceptions which in one moral
        latitude take the form of nymphs, or fairies, or sportive legends,
        appear in another as dæmons or appalling apparitions. Sometimes we
        can discover the precise natural fact which the superstition had
        misread. Thus, epilepsy, the phenomenon of nightmare, and that form
        of madness which leads men to imagine themselves transformed into
        some animal, are, doubtless, the explanation of many tales of
        demoniacal possession, of incubi, and of lycanthropy. In other cases
        we may detect a single error, such as the notion that the sky is
        close to the earth, or that the sun revolves around the globe, which
        had suggested the legend. But more frequently we can give only a
        general explanation, enabling us to assign these legends to their
        place, as the normal expression of a certain stage of knowledge or
        intellectual power; and this explanation is their refutation. We do
        not say that they are impossible, or even that they are not
        authenticated by as much evidence as many facts we believe. We only
        say that, in certain conditions of society, illusions of the kind
        inevitably appear. No one can prove that there are no such things as
        ghosts; but if a man whose brain is reeling with fever declares that
        he has seen one, we have no great difficulty in forming an opinion
        about his assertion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gradual
        decadence of miraculous narratives which accompanies advancing
        civilisation may be chiefly traced to three causes. The first is that
        general accuracy of observation and of statement which all education
        tends more or less to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg
        353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        produce, which checks the amplifications of the undisciplined
        imagination, and is speedily followed by a much stronger moral
        feeling on the subject of truth than ever exists in a rude
        civilisation. The second is an increased power of abstraction, which
        is likewise a result of general education, and which, by correcting
        the early habit of personifying all phenomena, destroys one of the
        most prolific sources of legends, and closes the mythical period of
        history. The third is the progress of physical science, which
        gradually dispels that conception of a universe governed by perpetual
        and arbitrary interference, from which, for the most part, these
        legends originally sprang. The whole history of physical science is
        one continued revelation of the reign of law. The same law that
        governs the motions of a grain of dust, or the light of the
        glowworm's lamp, is shown to preside over the march of the most
        majestic planet or the fire of the most distant sun. Countless
        phenomena, which were for centuries universally believed to be the
        results of spiritual agency, portents of calamity, or acts of Divine
        vengeance, have been one by one explained, have been shown to rise
        from blind physical causes, to be capable of prediction, or amenable
        to human remedies. Forms of madness which were for ages supposed to
        result from possession, are treated successfully in our hospitals.
        The advent of the comet is predicted. The wire invented by the
        sceptic Franklin defends the crosses on our churches from the
        lightning stroke of heaven. Whether we examine the course of the
        planets or the world of the animalculæ; to whatever field of physical
        nature our research is turned, the uniform, invariable result of
        scientific enquiry is to show that even the most apparently irregular
        and surprising phenomena are governed by natural antecedents, and are
        parts of one great connected system. From this vast concurrence of
        evidence, from this uniformity of experience in so many spheres,
        there arises in the minds of scientific men a conviction, amounting
        to absolute moral certainty, that the whole course of physical
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354"
        id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nature is governed by law,
        that the notion of the perpetual interference of the Deity with some
        particular classes of its phenomena is false and unscientific, and
        that the theological habit of interpreting the catastrophes of nature
        as Divine warnings or punishments, or disciplines, is a baseless and
        a pernicious superstition.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The effects of
        these discoveries upon miraculous legends are of various kinds. In
        the first place, a vast number which have clustered around the notion
        of the irregularity of some phenomenon which is proved to be
        regular—such as the innumerable accounts collected by the ancients to
        corroborate their opinion of the portentous nature of comets—are
        directly overthrown. In the next place, the revelation of the
        interdependence of phenomena greatly increases the improbability of
        some legends which it does not actually disprove. Thus, when men
        believed the sun to be simply a lamp revolving around and lighting
        our world, they had no great difficulty in believing that it was one
        day literally arrested in its course, to illuminate an army which was
        engaged in massacring its enemies; but the case became different when
        it was perceived that the sun was the centre of a vast system of
        worlds, which a suspension of the earth's motion must have reduced to
        chaos, without a miracle extending through it all. Thus, again, the
        old belief that some animals became for the first time carnivorous in
        consequence of the sin of Adam, appeared tolerably simple so long as
        this revolution was supposed to be only a change of habits or of
        tastes; but it became more difficult of belief when it was shown to
        involve a change of teeth; and the difficulty was, I suppose, still
        further aggravated when it was proved that, every animal having
        digestive organs specially adapted to its food, these also must have
        been changed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the last place,
        physical science exercises a still wider influence by destroying what
        I have called the centre ideas out of which countless particular
        theories were evolved, of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page355">[pg
        355]</span><a name="Pg355" id="Pg355" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which they were the natural expression, and upon which their
        permanence depends. Proving that our world is not the centre of the
        universe, but is a simple planet, revolving with many others around a
        common sun; proving that the disturbances and sufferings of the world
        do not result from an event which occurred but 6,000 years ago; that
        long before that period the earth was dislocated by the most fearful
        convulsions; that countless generations of sentient animals, and
        also, as recent discoveries appear conclusively to show, of men, not
        only lived but died; proving, by an immense accumulation of evidence,
        that the notion of a universe governed by isolated acts of special
        intervention is untrue—physical science had given new directions to
        the currents of the imagination, supplied the judgment with new
        measures of probability, and thus affected the whole circle of our
        beliefs.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With most men,
        however, the transition is as yet but imperfectly accomplished, and
        that part of physical nature which science has hitherto failed to
        explain is regarded as a sphere of special interposition. Thus,
        multitudes who recognise the fact that the celestial phenomena are
        subject to inflexible law, imagine that the dispensation of rain is
        in some sense the result of arbitrary interpositions, determined by
        the conduct of mankind. Near the equator, it is true, it is tolerably
        constant and capable of prediction; but in proportion as we recede
        from the equator, the rainfall becomes more variable, and
        consequently, in the eyes of some, supernatural, and although no
        scientific man has the faintest doubt that it is governed by laws as
        inflexible as those which determine the motions of the planets, yet
        because, owing to the great complexity of the determining causes, we
        are unable fully to explain them, it is still customary to speak of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“plagues of rain and water”</span> sent on
        account of our sins, and of <span class="tei tei-q">“scarcity and
        dearth, which we most justly suffer for our iniquity.”</span>
        Corresponding language is employed about the forms of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356" id="Pg356"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> disease and death which science has but
        imperfectly explained. If men are employed in some profession which
        compels them to inhale steel filings or noxious vapours, or if they
        live in a pestilential marsh, the diseases that result from these
        conditions are not regarded as a judgment or a discipline, for the
        natural cause is obvious and decisive. But if the conditions that
        produced the disease are very subtle and very complicated; if
        physicians are incapable of tracing with certainty its nature or its
        effects; if, above all, it assumes the character of an epidemic, it
        is continually treated as a Divine judgment. The presumption against
        this view arises not only from the fact that, in exact proportion as
        medical science advances, diseases are proved to be the necessary
        consequence of physical conditions, but also from many
        characteristics of unexplained disease which unequivocally prove it
        to be natural. Thus, cholera, which is frequently treated according
        to the theological method, varies with the conditions of temperature,
        is engendered by particular forms of diet, follows the course of
        rivers, yields in some measure to medical treatment, can be
        aggravated or mitigated by courses of conduct that have no relation
        to vice or virtue, takes its victims indiscriminately from all grades
        of morals or opinion. Usually, when definite causes are assigned for
        a supposed judgment, they lead to consequences of the most grotesque
        absurdity. Thus, when a deadly and mysterious disease fell upon the
        cattle of England, some divines, not content with treating it as a
        judgment, proceeded to trace it to certain popular writings
        containing what were deemed heterodox opinions about the Pentateuch,
        or about the eternity of punishment. It may be true that the disease
        was imported from a country where such speculations are unknown; that
        the authors objected to had no cattle; that the farmers, who chiefly
        suffered by the disease, were for the most part absolutely
        unconscious of the existence of these books, and if they <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> knew them would have indignantly
        repudiated them; that the town populations, who chiefly read them,
        were only affected indirectly by a rise in the price of food, which
        falls with perfect impartiality upon the orthodox and upon the
        heterodox; that particular counties were peculiarly sufferers,
        without being at all conspicuous for their scepticism; that similar
        writings appeared in former periods, without cattle being in any
        respect the worse; and that, at the very period at which the plague
        was raging, other countries, in which far more audacious speculations
        were rife, enjoyed an absolute immunity. In the face of all these
        consequences, the theory has been confidently urged and warmly
        applauded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not, I
        think, sufficiently observed how large a proportion of such questions
        are capable of a strictly inductive method of discussion. If it is
        said that plagues or pestilences are sent as a punishment of error or
        of vice, the assertion must be tested by a comprehensive examination
        of the history of plagues on the one hand, and of periods of great
        vice and heterodoxy on the other. If it be said that an influence
        more powerful than any military agency directs the course of battles,
        the action of this force must be detected as we would detect
        electricity, or any other force, by experiment. If the attribute of
        infallibility be ascribed to a particular Church, an inductive
        reasoner will not be content with enquiring how far an infallible
        Church would be a desirable thing, or how far certain ancient words
        may be construed as a prediction of its appearance; he will examine,
        by a wide and careful survey of ecclesiastical history, whether this
        Church has actually been immutable and consistent in its teaching;
        whether it has never been affected by the ignorance or the passion of
        the age; whether its influence has uniformly been exerted on the side
        which proved to be true; whether it has never supported by its
        authority scientific views which were afterwards demonstrated to be
        false, or countenanced and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page358">[pg
        358]</span><a name="Pg358" id="Pg358" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        consolidated popular errors, or thrown obstacles in the path of those
        who were afterwards recognised as the enlighteners of mankind. If
        ecclesiastical deliberations are said to be specially inspired or
        directed by an illuminating and supernatural power, we should examine
        whether the councils and convocations of clergymen exhibit a degree
        and harmony of wisdom that cannot reasonably be accounted for by the
        play of our unassisted faculties. If institutions are said to owe
        their growth to special supernatural agencies, distinct from the
        ordinary system of natural laws, we must examine whether their
        courses are so striking and so peculiar that natural laws fail to
        explain them. Whenever, as in the case of a battle, very many
        influences concur to the result, it will frequently happen that that
        result will baffle our predictions. It will also happen that strange
        coincidences, such as the frequent recurrence of the same number in a
        game of chance, will occur. But there are limits to these variations
        from what we regard as probable. If, in throwing the dice, we
        uniformly attained the same number, or if in war the army which was
        most destitute of all military advantages was uniformly victorious,
        we should readily infer that some special cause was operating to
        produce the result. We must remember, too, that in every great
        historical crisis the prevalence of either side will bring with it a
        long train of consequences, and that we only see one side of the
        picture. If Hannibal, after his victory at Cannæ, had captured and
        burnt Rome, the vast series of results that have followed from the
        ascendancy of the Roman Empire would never have taken place, but the
        supremacy of a maritime, commercial, and comparatively pacific power
        would have produced an entirely different series, which would have
        formed the basis and been the essential condition of all the
        subsequent progress; a civilisation, the type and character of which
        it is now impossible to conjecture, would have arisen, and its
        theologians would probably have regarded the career of Hannibal as
        one <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg 359]</span><a name=
        "Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the most manifest
        instances of special interposition on record.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we would form
        sound opinions on these matters, we must take a very wide and
        impartial survey of the phenomena of history. We must examine whether
        events have tended in a given direction with a uniformity or a
        persistence that is not naturally explicable. We must examine not
        only the facts that corroborate our theory, but also those which
        oppose it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That such a method
        is not ordinarily adopted must be manifest to all. As Bacon said, men
        <span class="tei tei-q">“mark the hits, but not the misses;”</span>
        they collect industriously the examples in which many, and sometimes
        improbable, circumstances have converged to a result which they
        consider good, and they simply leave out of their consideration the
        circumstances that tend in the opposite direction. They expatiate
        with triumph upon the careers of emperors who have been the
        unconscious pioneers or agents in some great movement of human
        progress, but they do not dwell upon those whose genius was expended
        in a hopeless resistance, or upon those who, like Bajazet or
        Tamerlane, having inflicted incalculable evils upon mankind, passed
        away, leaving no enduring fruit behind them. A hundred missionaries
        start upon an enterprise, the success of which appears exceedingly
        improbable. Ninety-nine perish and are forgotten. One missionary
        succeeds, and his success is attributed to supernatural interference,
        because the probabilities were so greatly against him. It is observed
        that a long train of political or military events ensured the triumph
        of Protestantism in certain nations and periods. It is forgotten that
        another train of events destroyed the same faith in other lands, and
        paralysed the efforts of its noblest martyrs. We are told of showers
        of rain that followed public prayer; but we are not told how often
        prayers for rain proved abortive, or how much longer than usual the
        dry weather had already continued when they were <span class=

        old philosopher observed, the votive tablets of those who escaped are
        suspended in the temple, while those who were shipwrecked are
        forgotten.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately,
        these inconsistencies do not arise simply from intellectual causes. A
        feeling which was intended to be religious, but which was in truth
        deeply the reverse, once led men to shrink from examining the causes
        of some of the more terrible of physical phenomena, because it was
        thought that these should be deemed special instances of Divine
        interference, and should, therefore, be regarded as too sacred for
        investigation.<a id="noteref_655" name="noteref_655" href=
        "#note_655"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">655</span></span></a> In the
        world of physical science this mode of thought has almost vanished,
        but a corresponding sentiment may be often detected in the common
        judgments of history. Very many well-meaning men—censuring the
        pursuit of truth in the name of the God of Truth—while they regard it
        as commendable and religious to collect facts illustrating
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name="Pg361"
        id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or corroborating the
        theological theory of life, consider it irreverent and wrong to apply
        to those facts, and to that theory, the ordinary severity of
        inductive reasoning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What I have
        written is not in any degree inconsistent with the belief that, by
        the dispensation of Providence, moral causes have a natural and often
        overwhelming influence upon happiness and upon success, nor yet with
        the belief that our moral nature enters into a very real, constant,
        and immediate contact with a higher power. Nor does it at all
        disprove the possibility of Divine interference with the order even
        of physical nature. A world governed by special acts of intervention,
        such as that which mediæval theologians imagined, is perfectly
        conceivable, though it is probable that most impartial enquirers will
        convince themselves that this is not the system of the planet we
        inhabit; and if any instance of such interference be sufficiently
        attested, it should not be rejected as intrinsically impossible. It
        is, however, the fundamental error of most writers on miracles, that
        they confine their attention to two points—the possibility of the
        fact, and the nature of the evidence. There is a third element, which
        in these questions is of capital importance: the predisposition of
        men in certain stages of society towards the miraculous, which is so
        strong that miraculous stories are then invariably circulated and
        credited, and which makes an amount of evidence that would be quite
        sufficient to establish a natural fact, altogether inadequate to
        establish a supernatural one. The positions for which I have been
        contending are that a perpetual interference of the Deity with the
        natural course of events is the earliest and simplest notion of
        miracles, and that this notion, which is implied in so many systems
        of belief, arose in part from an ignorance of the laws of nature, and
        in part also from an incapacity for inductive reasoning, which led
        men merely to collect facts coinciding with their preconceived
        opinions, without attending to those that were inconsistent with
        them. By this method there is no superstition <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that could not be defended. Volumes have
        been written giving perfectly authentic histories of wars, famines,
        and pestilences that followed the appearance of comets. There is not
        an omen, not a prognostic, however childish, that has not, in the
        infinite variety of events, been occasionally verified, and to minds
        that are under the influence of a superstitious imagination these
        occasional verifications more than outweigh all the instances of
        error. Simple knowledge is wholly insufficient to correct the
        disease. No one is so firmly convinced of the reality of lucky and
        unlucky days, and of supernatural portents, as the sailor, who has
        spent his life in watching the deep, and has learnt to read with
        almost unerring skill the promise of the clouds. No one is more
        persuaded of the superstitions about fortune than the habitual
        gambler. Sooner than abandon his theory, there is no extravagance of
        hypothesis to which the superstitious man will not resort. The
        ancients were convinced that dreams were usually supernatural. If the
        dream was verified, this was plainly a prophecy. If the event was the
        exact opposite of what the dream foreshadowed, the latter was still
        supernatural, for it was a recognised principle that dreams should
        sometimes be interpreted by contraries. If the dream bore no relation
        to subsequent events, unless it were transformed into a fantastic
        allegory, it was still supernatural, for allegory was one of the most
        ordinary forms of revelation. If no ingenuity of interpretation could
        find a prophetic meaning in a dream, its supernatural character was
        even then not necessarily destroyed; for Homer said there was a
        special portal through which deceptive visions passed into the mind,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To estimate aright
        the force of the predisposition to the miraculous should be one of
        the first tasks of the enquirer into its reality; and no one, I
        think, can examine the subject with <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        that in many periods of history it has been so strong as to
        accumulate around pure delusions an amount of evidence far greater
        than would be sufficient to establish even improbable natural facts.
        Through the entire duration of Pagan Rome, it was regarded as an
        unquestionable truth, established by the most ample experience, that
        prodigies of various kinds announced every memorable event, and that
        sacrifices had the power of mitigating or arresting calamity. In the
        Republic, the Senate itself officially verified and explained the
        prodigies.<a id="noteref_656" name="noteref_656" href=

        Empire there is not an historian, from Tacitus down to the meanest
        writer in the Augustan history, who was not convinced that numerous
        prodigies foreshadowed the accession and death of every sovereign,
        and every great catastrophe that fell upon the people. Cicero could
        say with truth that there was not a single nation of antiquity, from
        the polished Greek to the rudest savage, which did not admit the
        existence of a real art enabling men to foretell the future, and that
        the splendid temples of the oracles, which for so many centuries
        commanded the reverence of mankind, sufficiently attested the
        intensity of the belief.<a id="noteref_657" name="noteref_657" href=

        reality of the witch miracles was established by a critical tribunal,
        which, however imperfect, was at least the most searching then

        every European country, supported by the unanimous voice of public
        opinion, and corroborated by the investigation of some of the ablest
        men during several centuries. The belief that the king's touch can

        of Oxford, and by the enthusiastic assent of the people. It survived
        the ages of the Reformation, of Bacon, of Milton, and of Hobbes. It
        was by no means extinct in the age of Locke, and would probably have
        lasted still longer, had not the change of dynasty at the Revolution
        assisted the tardy scepticism.<a id="noteref_659" name="noteref_659"

        scarcely an educated man who will defend these miracles. Considered
        abstractedly, indeed, it is perfectly conceivable that Providence
        might have announced coming events by prodigies, or imparted to some
        one a miraculous power, or permitted evil spirits to exist among
        mankind and assist them in their enterprises. The evidence
        establishing these miracles is cumulative, and it is immeasurably
        greater than the evidence of many natural facts, such as the
        earthquakes at Antioch, which no one would dream of questioning. We
        disbelieve the miracles, because an overwhelming experience proves
        that in certain intellectual conditions, and under the influence of
        certain errors which we are enabled to trace, superstitions of this
        order invariably appear and flourish, and that, when these
        intellectual conditions have passed, the prodigies as invariably
        cease, and the whole fabric of superstition melts silently away.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is extremely
        difficult for an ordinary man, who is little conversant with the
        writings of the past, and who unconsciously transfers to other ages
        the critical spirit of his own, to realise the fact that histories of
        the most grotesquely extravagant nature could, during the space of
        many centuries, be continually propounded without either provoking
        the smallest question or possessing the smallest truth. We may,
        however, understand something of this credulity when we remember the
        diversion of the ancient mind from physical science to speculative
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366"
        id="Pg366" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> philosophy; the want of the
        many checks upon error which printing affords; the complete absence
        of that habit of cautious, experimental research which Bacon and his
        contemporaries infused into modern philosophy; and, in Christian
        times, the theological notion that the spirit of belief is a virtue,
        and the spirit of scepticism a sin. We must remember, too, that
        before men had found the key to the motions of the heavenly
        bodies—before the false theory of the vortices and the true theory of
        gravitation—when the multitude of apparently capricious phenomena was
        very great, the notion that the world was governed by distinct and
        isolated influences was that which appeared most probable even to the
        most rational intellect. In such a condition of knowledge—which was
        that of the most enlightened days of the Roman Empire—the hypothesis
        of universal law was justly regarded as a rash and premature
        generalisation. Every enquirer was confronted with innumerable
        phenomena that were deemed plainly miraculous. When Lucretius sought
        to banish the supernatural from the universe, he was compelled to
        employ much ingenuity in endeavouring to explain, by a natural law,
        why a miraculous fountain near the temple of Jupiter Ammon was hot by
        night and cold by day, and why the temperature of wells was higher in
        winter than in summer.<a id="noteref_660" name="noteref_660" href=

        Sometimes we find this credulity broken by curious inconsistencies of
        belief, or semi-rationalistic explanations. Livy, who relates with
        perfect faith innumerable prodigies, has observed, nevertheless,

        who admitted most fully the reality of the oracles occasionally
        represented them as natural contending that a prophetic faculty was
        innate in all men, though dormant in most; that it might be quickened
        into action by sleep, by a pure and ascetic life, or in the
        prostration that precedes death, or in the delirium produced by
        certain vapours; and that the gradual enfeebling of the last was the

        natural antecedents. The Greeks believed that they were caused by
        subterranean waters, and they accordingly sacrificed to Poseidon. The

        Aristotle, the greatest naturalist of Greece, had observed that it
        was a curious fact that on the sea-shore no animal ever dies except
        during the ebbing of the tide. Several centuries later, Pliny, the

        every facility for the detection of the imposture. In the field of

        which I have traced in the last chapter, had produced a very

        preceded the conversion of Constantine. Neither the writings of

        philosophy which rejected, the Academic philosophy which doubted, and
        the Stoic philosophy which simplified and sublimated superstition,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Christianity
        floated into the Roman Empire on the wave of credulity that brought
        with it this long train of Oriental <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page374">[pg 374]</span><a name="Pg374" id="Pg374" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> superstitions and legends. In its moral aspect
        it was broadly distinguished from the systems around it, but its
        miracles were accepted by both friend and foe as the ordinary
        accompaniments of religious teaching. The Jews, in the eyes of the
        Pagans, had long been proverbial for their credulity,<a id=
        "noteref_697" name="noteref_697" href="#note_697"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">697</span></span></a> and the
        Christians inherited a double measure of their reputation. Nor is it
        possible to deny that in the matter of the miraculous the reputation
        was deserved. Among the Pagans the theory of Euhemerus, who believed
        the gods to be but deified men, had been the stronghold of the
        Sceptics, while the Platonic notion of dæmons was adopted by the more
        believing philosophers. The Christian teachers combined both
        theories, maintaining that deceased kings had originally supplied the
        names of the deities, but that malevolent dæmons had taken their
        places; and without a single exception the Fathers maintained the
        reality of the Pagan miracles as fully as their own.<a id=
        "noteref_698" name="noteref_698" href="#note_698"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">698</span></span></a> The
        oracles, as we have seen, had been ridiculed and rejected by numbers
        of the philosophers, but the Christians unanimously admitted their
        reality. They appealed to a long series of oracles as predictions of
        their faith; and there is, I believe, no example of the denial of
        their supernatural character in the Christian Church till 1696, when
        a Dutch Anabaptist minister named Van Dale, in a remarkable
        book,<a id="noteref_699" name="noteref_699" href=
        "#note_699"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg375" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> which was abridged and
        translated by Fontenelle, asserted, in opposition to the unanimous
        voice of ecclesiastical authority, that they were simple impostures—a
        theory which is now almost universally accepted. To suppose that men
        who held these opinions were capable, in the second or third
        centuries, of ascertaining with any degree of just confidence whether
        miracles had taken place in Judæa in the first century, is grossly
        absurd; nor would the conviction of their reality have made any great
        impression on their minds at a time when miracles were supposed to be
        so abundantly diffused.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In truth, the
        question of the reality of the Jewish miracles must be carefully
        distinguished from that of the conversion of the Roman Empire. With
        the light that is furnished to us by modern investigations and habits
        of thought, we weigh the testimony of the Jewish writers; but most of
        the more judicious of modern apologists, considering the extreme
        credulity of the Jewish people, decline to make the question simply
        one of evidence, and occupy themselves chiefly in endeavouring to
        show that miracles are possible, that those recorded in the Biblical
        narratives are related in such a manner, and are so interwoven with
        the texture of a simple and artless narrative, as to carry with them
        an internal proof of their reality; that they differ in kind from
        later miracles, and especially that the character and destinies of
        Christianity are such as to render its miraculous origin antecedently
        probable. But in the ages when the Roman Empire was chiefly
        converted, all sound and discriminating historical investigation of
        the evidence of the early miracles was impossible, nor was any large
        use made of those miracles as proofs of the religion. The rhetorician
        Arnobius is probably the only one of the early apologists who gives,
        among the evidences of the faith, any prominent place to the miracles
        of Christ.<a id="noteref_700" name="noteref_700" href=

        employed, it was usually an appeal not to miracles, but to prophecy.
        But here again the opinions of the patristic age must be pronounced
        absolutely worthless. To prove that events had taken place in Judæa,
        accurately corresponding with the prophecies, or that the prophecies
        were themselves genuine, were both tasks far transcending the
        critical powers of the Roman converts. The wild extravagance of
        fantastic allegory, commonly connected with Origen, but which appears
        at a much earlier date in the writings of Justin Martyr and Irenæus,
        had thrown the interpretation of prophecy into hopeless confusion,
        while the deliberate and apparently perfectly unscrupulous forgery of
        a whole literature, destined to further the propagation either of
        Christianity as a whole, or of some particular class of tenets that
        had arisen within its border,<a id="noteref_701" name="noteref_701"

        criticism at once pre-eminently difficult and necessary. A long
        series of oracles were cited, predicting in detail the sufferings of
        Christ. The prophecies forged by the Christians, and attributed by
        them to the heathen Sibyls, were accepted as genuine by the entire
        Church, and were continually appealed to as among the most powerful
        evidences of the faith. Justin Martyr declared that it was by the
        instigation of dæmons that it had been made a capital offence to read
        them.<a id="noteref_702" name="noteref_702" href=

        there was not a single Christian writer of the patristic period who
        disputed their authority, and there were very few even of the most
        illustrious who did not appeal to them. Unanimously admitted by the
        Church of the Fathers, they were unanimously admitted during the
        middle ages, and an allusion to them passed into the most beautiful
        lyric of the Missal. It was only at the period of the Reformation
        that the great but unhappy Castellio pointed out many passages in
        them which could not possibly be genuine. He was followed, in the
        first years of the seventeenth century, by a Jesuit named Possevin,
        who observed that the Sibyls were known to have lived at a later
        period than Moses, and that many passages in the Sibylline books
        purported to have been written before Moses. Those passages,
        therefore, he said, were interpolated; and he added, with a
        characteristic sagacity, that they had doubtless been inserted by
        Satan, for the purpose of throwing suspicion upon the books.<a id=

        in 1649 that a French Protestant minister, named Blondel, ventured
        for the first time in the Christian Church to denounce these writings
        as deliberate and clumsy forgeries, and after much angry controversy
        his sentiment has acquired an almost undisputed ascendancy in
        criticism.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But although the
        opinion of the Roman converts was extremely worthless, when dealing
        with past history or with literary criticism, there was one branch of
        miracles concerning which their position was somewhat different.
        Contemporary <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page378">[pg
        378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        miracles, often of the most extraordinary character, but usually of
        the nature of visions, exorcisms, or healing the sick, were from the
        time of Justin Martyr uniformly represented by the Fathers as
        existing among them,<a id="noteref_709" name="noteref_709" href=
        "#note_709"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">709</span></span></a> and
        they continue steadily along the path of history, till in the pages
        of Evagrius and Theodoret, in the Lives of Hilarion and Paul, by St.
        Jerome, of Antony, by St. Athanasius, and of Gregory Thaumaturgus, by
        his namesake of Nyssa, and in the Dialogues of St. Gregory the Great,
        they attain as grotesque an extravagance as the wildest mediæval
        legends. Few things are more striking than the assertions hazarded on
        this matter by some of the ablest of the Fathers. Thus, St. Irenæus
        assures us that all Christians possessed the power of working
        miracles; that they prophesied, cast out devils, healed the sick, and
        sometimes even raised the dead; that some who had been thus
        resuscitated lived for many years among them, and that it would be
        impossible to reckon the wonderful acts that were daily
        performed.<a id="noteref_710" name="noteref_710" href=

        Epiphanius tells us that some rivers and fountains were annually
        transformed into wine, in attestation of the miracle of Cana; and he
        adds that he had himself drunk of one of these fountains, and his
        brethren of another.<a id="noteref_711" name="noteref_711" href=

        Augustine notices that miracles were less frequent and less widely
        known than formerly, but that many still occurred, and some of them
        he had himself witnessed. Whenever a miracle was reported, he ordered
        that a special examination into its circumstances should be made, and
        that the depositions of the witnesses should be read publicly to the
        people. He tells us, besides many other miracles, that Gamaliel in a
        dream revealed to a priest named Lucianus the place where the bones
        of St. Stephen were buried; that those bones, being thus discovered,
        were brought to Hippo, the diocese of which St. Augustine was bishop;
        that they raised <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg
        379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        five dead persons to life; and that, although only a portion of the
        miraculous cures they effected had been registered, the certificates
        drawn up in two years in the diocese, and by the orders of the saint,
        were nearly seventy. In the adjoining diocese of Calama they were
        incomparably more numerous.<a id="noteref_712" name="noteref_712"
        href="#note_712"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">712</span></span></a> In the
        height of the great conflict between St. Ambrose and the Arian
        Empress Justina, the saint declared that it had been revealed to him
        by an irresistible presentiment—or, as St. Augustine, who was present
        on the occasion, says, in a dream—that relics were buried in a spot
        which he indicated. The earth being removed, a tomb was found filled
        with blood, and containing two gigantic skeletons, with their heads
        severed from their bodies, which were pronounced to be those of St.
        Gervasius and St. Protasius, two martyrs of remarkable physical
        dimensions, who were said to have suffered about 300 years before. To
        prove that they were genuine relics, the bones were brought in
        contact with a blind man, who was restored to sight, and with
        demoniacs, who were cured; the dæmons, however, in the first place,
        acknowledging that the relics were genuine; that St. Ambrose was the
        deadly enemy of the powers of hell; that the Trinitarian doctrine was
        true; and that those who rejected it would infallibly be damned. The
        next day St. Ambrose delivered an invective against all who
        questioned the miracle. St. Augustine recorded it in his works, and
        spread the worship of the saints through Africa. The transport of
        enthusiasm with which the miracles were greeted at Milan enabled St.
        Ambrose to overcome every obstacle; but the Arians treated them with
        a derisive incredulity, and declared that the pretended demoniacs had
        been bribed by the saint.<a id="noteref_713" name="noteref_713" href=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> many that are equally positive, though not
        equally precise, suggest veins of thought of obvious interest and
        importance. We are now, however, only concerned with the fact, that,
        with the exception of one or two isolated miracles, such as the last
        I have noticed, and of one class of miracles which I shall proceed to
        describe, these prodigies, whether true or false, were wrought for
        the exclusive edification of confirmed believers. The exceptional
        miracles were those of exorcism, which occupied a very singular
        position in the early Church. The belief that certain diseases were
        inflicted by Divine agency was familiar to the ancients, but among
        the early Greeks the notion of diabolical possession appears to have
        been unknown. A dæmon, in the philosophy of Plato, though inferior to
        a deity, was not an evil spirit, and it is extremely doubtful whether
        the existence of evil dæmons was known either to the Greeks or Romans
        till about the time of the advent of Christ.<a id="noteref_714" name=
        "noteref_714" href="#note_714"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">714</span></span></a> The
        belief was introduced with the Oriental superstitions which then
        poured into Rome, and it brought in its train the notions of
        possession and exorcism. The Jews, who in their own country appear to
        have regarded it as a most ordinary occurrence to meet men walking
        about visibly possessed by devils, and who professed to have learnt
        from Solomon the means of expelling them, soon became the principal
        exorcists, accomplishing their feats partly by adjuration, and partly
        by means of a certain miraculous root named Baaras. Josephus assures
        us that he had himself, in the reign of Vespasian, seen a Jew named
        Eleazar drawing by these means a dæmon through the nostrils of a
        possessed person, who fell to the ground on the accomplishment of the
        miracle; while, upon the command of the magician, the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg 381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> devil, to prove that it had really left
        his victim, threw down a cup of water which had been placed at a
        distance.<a id="noteref_715" name="noteref_715" href=
        "#note_715"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">715</span></span></a> The
        growth of Neoplatonism and kindred philosophies greatly strengthened
        the belief, and some of the later philosophers, as well as many
        religious charlatans, practised exorcism. But, of all classes, the
        Christians became in this respect the most famous. From the time of
        Justin Martyr, for about two centuries, there is, I believe, not a
        single Christian writer who does not solemnly and explicitly assert
        the reality and frequent employment of this power;<a id="noteref_716"
        name="noteref_716" href="#note_716"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">716</span></span></a> and
        although, after the Council of Laodicea, the instances became less
        numerous, they by no means ceased. The Christians fully recognised
        the supernatural power possessed by the Jewish and Gentile exorcists,
        but they claimed to be in many respects their superiors. By the
        simple sign of the cross, or by repeating the name of their Master,
        they professed to be able to cast out devils which had resisted all
        the enchantments of Pagan <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg
        382]</span><a name="Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        exorcists, to silence the oracles, to compel the dæmons to confess
        the truth of the Christian faith. Sometimes their power extended
        still further. Dæmons, we are told, were accustomed to enter into
        animals, and these also were expelled by the Christian adjuration.
        St. Jerome, in his <span class="tei tei-q">“Life of St.
        Hilarion,”</span> has given us a graphic account of the courage with
        which that saint confronted, and the success with which he relieved,
        a possessed camel.<a id="noteref_717" name="noteref_717" href=

        reign of Julian, the very bones of the martyr Babylas were sufficient
        to silence the oracle of Daphne; and when, amid the triumphant chants
        of the Christians, the relics, by the command of Julian, were
        removed, the lightning descended from heaven and consumed the
        temple.<a id="noteref_718" name="noteref_718" href=

        Gregory Thaumaturgus having expelled the dæmons from an idol temple,
        the priest, finding his means of subsistence destroyed, came to the
        saint, imploring him to permit the oracles to be renewed. St.
        Gregory, who was then on his journey, wrote a note containing the
        words <span class="tei tei-q">“Satan, return,”</span> which was
        immediately obeyed, and the priest, awe-struck by the miracle, was
        converted to Christianity.<a id="noteref_719" name="noteref_719"

        Tertullian, writing to the Pagans in a time of persecution, in
        language of the most deliberate earnestness, challenges his opponents
        to bring forth any person who is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page383">[pg 383]</span><a name="Pg383" id="Pg383" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> possessed by a dæmon or any of those virgins or
        prophets who are supposed to be inspired by a divinity. He asserts
        that, in reply to the interrogation of any Christian, the dæmons will
        be compelled to confess their diabolical character; he invites the
        Pagans, if it be otherwise, to put the Christian immediately to
        death; and he proposes this as at once the simplest and most decisive
        demonstration of the faith.<a id="noteref_720" name="noteref_720"

        language equally solemn and explicit, call upon the Pagans to form
        their opinions from the confessions wrung from their own gods. We
        hear from them, that when a Christian began to pray, to make the sign
        of the cross, or to utter the name of his Master in the presence of a
        possessed or inspired person, the latter, by screams and frightful
        contortions, exhibited the torture that was inflicted, and by this
        torture the evil spirit was compelled to avow its nature. Several of
        the Christian writers declare that this was generally known to the
        Pagans. In one respect, it was observed, the miracle of exorcism was
        especially available for evidential purposes; for, as dæmons would
        not expel dæmons, it was the only miracle which was necessarily
        divine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
        curious to examine the manner in which the challenge was received by
        the Pagan writers; but unhappily, the writings which were directed
        against the faith having been destroyed by the Christian emperors,
        our means of information on this point are very scanty. Some
        information, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page384">[pg
        384]</span><a name="Pg384" id="Pg384" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        however, we possess, and it would appear to show that, among the
        educated classes at least, these phenomena did not extort any great
        admiration. The eloquent silence about diabolical possession observed
        by the early philosophers, when discussing such questions as the
        nature of the soul and of the spiritual world, decisively show that
        in their time possession had not assumed any great prominence or
        acquired any general credence. Plutarch, who admitted the reality of
        evil dæmons, and who was the most strenuous defender of the oracles,
        treats the whole class of superstitions to which exorcism belongs
        with much contempt.<a id="noteref_726" name="noteref_726" href=

        most decisive evidence, however, we possess, is a law of Ulpian,
        directed, it is thought, against the Christians, which condemns those
        <span class="tei tei-q">“who use incantations or imprecations, or (to
        employ the common word of impostors) exorcisms.”</span><a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">730</span></span></a> Modern
        criticism has noted a few facts which may throw some light upon this
        obscure subject. It has been observed that the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page385">[pg 385]</span><a name="Pg385" id="Pg385"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> symptoms of possession were for the most
        part identical with those of lunacy or epilepsy; that it is quite
        possible that the excitement of an imposing religious ceremony might
        produce or suspend the disorder; that leading questions might in
        these cases be followed by the desired answers; and that some
        passages from the Fathers show that the exorcisms were not always
        successful, or the cures always permanent. It has been observed, too,
        that at first the power of exorcism was open to all Christians
        without restraint; that this licence, in an age when religious
        jugglers were very common, and in a Church whose members were very
        credulous, gave great facilities to impostors; that when the
        Laodicean Council, in the fourth century, forbade any one to
        exorcise, except those who were duly authorised by the bishop, these
        miracles speedily declined; and that, in the very beginning of the
        fifth century, a physician named Posidonius denied the existence of
        possession.<a id="noteref_731" name="noteref_731" href=
        "#note_731"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">731</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To sum up this
        whole subject, we may conclude that what is called the evidential
        system had no prominent place in effecting the conversion of the
        Roman Empire. Historical criticisms were far too imperfect to make
        appeals to the miracles of former days of any value, and the notion
        of the wide diffusion of miraculous or magical powers, as well as the
        generally private character of the alleged miracles of the Patristic
        age, made contemporary wonders very unimpressive. The prophecies
        attributed to the Sibyls, and the practice of exorcism, had, however,
        a certain weight; for the first were connected with a religious
        authority, long and deeply revered at Rome, and the second had been
        forced by several circumstances into great prominence. But the effect
        even of these may be safely regarded as altogether subsidiary, and
        the main causes of the conversion must be looked for in another and a
        wider sphere.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg
        386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These causes were
        the general tendencies of the age. They are to be found in that vast
        movement of mingled scepticism and credulity, in that amalgamation or
        dissolution of many creeds, in that profound transformation of
        habits, of feelings, and of ideals, which I have attempted to paint
        in the last chapter. Under circumstances more favourable to religious
        proselytism than the world had ever before known, with the path
        cleared by a long course of destructive criticism, the religions and
        philosophies of mankind were struggling for the mastery in that great
        metropolis where all were amply represented, and in which alone the
        destinies of the world could be decided. Among the educated a frigid
        Stoicism, teaching a majestic but unattainable grandeur, and scorning
        the support of the affections, the hope of another world, and the
        consolations of worship, had for a time been in the ascendant, and it
        only terminated its noble and most fruitful career when it had become
        manifestly inadequate to the religious wants of the age. Among other
        classes, religion after religion ran its conquering course. The Jews,
        although a number of causes had made them the most hated of all the
        Roman subjects, and although their religion, from its intensely
        national character, seemed peculiarly unsuited for proselytism, had
        yet, by the force of their monotheism, their charity, and their
        exorcisms, spread the creed of Moses far and wide. The Empress Poppæa
        is said to have been a proselyte. The passion of Roman women for
        Jewish rites was one of the complaints of Juvenal. The Sabbath and
        the Jewish fasts became familiar facts in all the great cities, and
        the antiquity of the Jewish law the subject of eager discussion.
        Other Oriental religions were even more successful. The worship of
        Mithra, and, above all, of the Egyptian divinities, attracted their
        thousands, and during more than three centuries the Roman writings
        are crowded with allusions to their progress. The mysteries of the
        Bona Dea,<a id="noteref_732" name="noteref_732" href=
        "#note_732"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">732</span></span></a> the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page387">[pg 387]</span><a name="Pg387"
        id="Pg387" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> solemn worship of Isis, the
        expiatory rites that cleansed the guilty soul, excited a very
        delirium of enthusiasm. Juvenal describes the Roman women, at the
        dawn of the winter day, breaking the ice of the Tiber to plunge three
        times into its sacred stream, dragging themselves on bleeding knees
        in penance around the field of Tarquin, offering to undertake
        pilgrimages to Egypt to seek the holy water for the shrine of Isis,
        fondly dreaming that they had heard the voice of the goddess.<a id=
        "noteref_733" name="noteref_733" href="#note_733"><span class=

        Apuleius has drawn a graphic picture of the solemn majesty of her

        Commodus, Caracalla, and Heliogabalus were passionately devoted to
        them.<a id="noteref_735" name="noteref_735" href=
        "#note_735"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">735</span></span></a> The
        temples of Isis and Serapis, and the statues of Mithra, are among the
        last prominent works of Roman art. In all other forms the same
        credulity was manifested. The oracles that had been silent were heard
        again; the astrologers swarmed in every city; the philosophers were
        surrounded with an atmosphere of legend; the Pythagorean school had
        raised credulity into a system. On all sides, and to a degree
        unparalleled in history, we find men who were no longer satisfied
        with their old local religion, thirsting for belief, passionately and
        restlessly seeking for a new faith.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the midst of
        this movement, Christianity gained its ascendancy, and we can be at
        no loss to discover the cause of its triumph. No other religion,
        under such circumstances, had ever combined so many distinct elements
        of power and attraction. Unlike the Jewish religion, it was bound by
        no local ties, and was equally adapted for every nation and for every
        class. Unlike Stoicism, it appealed in the strongest manner to the
        affections, and offered all the charm of a sympathetic worship.
        Unlike the Egyptian religions, it united with its distinctive
        teaching a pure and noble system of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page388">[pg 388]</span><a name="Pg388" id="Pg388" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> ethics, and proved itself capable of realising
        it in action. It proclaimed, amid a vast movement of social and
        national amalgamation, the universal brotherhood of mankind. Amid the
        softening influence of philosophy and civilisation, it taught the
        supreme sanctity of love. To the slave, who had never before
        exercised so large an influence over Roman religious life, it was the
        religion of the suffering and the oppressed. To the philosopher it
        was at once the echo of the highest ethics of the later Stoics, and
        the expansion of the best teaching of the school of Plato. To a world
        thirsting for prodigy, it offered a history replete with wonders more
        strange that those of Apollonius; while the Jew and the Chaldean
        could scarcely rival its exorcists, and the legends of continual
        miracles circulated among its followers. To a world deeply conscious
        of political dissolution, and prying eagerly and anxiously into the
        future, it proclaimed with a thrilling power the immediate
        destruction of the globe—the glory of all its friends, and the
        damnation of all its foes. To a world that had grown very weary
        gazing on the cold and passionless grandeur which Cato realised, and
        which Lucan sung, it presented an ideal of compassion and of love—a
        Teacher who could weep by the sepulchre of His friend, who was
        touched with the feeling of our infirmities. To a world, in fine,
        distracted by hostile creeds and colliding philosophies, it taught
        its doctrines, not as a human speculation, but as a Divine
        revelation, authenticated much less by reason than by faith.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“With the heart man believeth unto
        righteousness;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“He that doeth the
        will of my Father will know the doctrine, whether it be of
        God;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Unless you believe you cannot
        understand;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“A heart naturally
        Christian;”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The heart makes the
        theologian,”</span> are the phrases which best express the first
        action of Christianity upon the world. Like all great religions, it
        was more concerned with modes of feeling than with modes of thought.
        The chief cause of its success was the congruity of its teaching with
        the spiritual <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page389">[pg
        389]</span><a name="Pg389" id="Pg389" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        nature of mankind. It was because it was true to the moral sentiments
        of the age, because it represented faithfully the supreme type of
        excellence to which men were then tending, because it corresponded
        with their religious wants, aims, and emotions, because the whole
        spiritual being could then expand and expatiate under its influence,
        that it planted its roots so deeply in the hearts of men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all these
        elements of attraction, others of a different order must be added.
        Christianity was not merely a moral influence, or a system of
        opinions, or an historical record, or a collection of wonder-working
        men; it was also an institution definitely, elaborately, and
        skilfully organised, possessing a weight and a stability which
        isolated or undisciplined teachers could never rival, and evoking, to
        a degree before unexampled in the world, an enthusiastic devotion to
        its corporate welfare, analogous to that of the patriot to his
        country. The many forms of Pagan worship were pliant in their nature.
        Each offered certain advantages or spiritual gratifications; but
        there was no reason why all should not exist together, and
        participation in one by no means implied disrespect to the others.
        But Christianity was emphatically exclusive; its adherent was bound
        to detest and abjure the faiths around him as the workmanship of
        dæmons, and to consider himself placed in the world to destroy them.
        Hence there sprang a stern, aggressive, and at the same time
        disciplined enthusiasm, wholly unlike any other that had been
        witnessed upon earth. The duties of public worship; the sacraments,
        which were represented as the oaths of the Christian warrior; the
        fasts and penances and commemorative days, which strengthened the
        Church feeling; the intervention of religion in the most solemn
        epochs of life, conspired to sustain it. Above all, the doctrine of
        salvation by belief, which then for the first time flashed upon the
        world; the persuasion, realised with all the vividness of novelty,
        that Christianity opened out to its votaries eternal happiness,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page390">[pg 390]</span><a name="Pg390"
        id="Pg390" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> while all beyond its pale were
        doomed to an eternity of torture, supplied a motive of action as
        powerful as it is perhaps possible to conceive. It struck alike the
        coarsest chords of hope and fear, and the finest chords of compassion
        and love. The polytheist, admitting that Christianity might possibly
        be true, was led by a mere calculation of prudence to embrace it, and
        the fervent Christian would shrink from no suffering to draw those
        whom he loved within its pale. Nor were other inducements wanting. To
        the confessor was granted in the Church a great and venerable
        authority, such as the bishop could scarcely claim.<a id=

        martyr, besides the fruition of heaven, belonged the highest glory on

        Regulus. His body was laid to rest with a sumptuous splendour;<a id=

        relics, embalmed or shrined, were venerated with an almost idolatrous
        homage. The anniversary of his birth into another life was

        saints his heroic sufferings were recounted.<a id="noteref_738" name=

        a moment effaced.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Those who are
        accustomed to recognise heroic enthusiasm as a normal product of
        certain natural conditions, will have no difficulty in understanding

        "page391">[pg 391]</span><a name="Pg391" id="Pg391" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> as I have described, a transcendent courage
        should have been evoked. Men seemed indeed to be in love with death.
        Believing, with St. Ignatius, that they were <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the wheat of God,”</span> they panted for the day when
        they should be <span class="tei tei-q">“ground by the teeth of wild
        beasts into the pure bread of Christ!”</span> Beneath this one
        burning enthusiasm all the ties of earthly love were snapt in twain.
        Origen, when a boy, being restrained by force from going forth to
        deliver himself up to the persecutors, wrote to his imprisoned
        father, imploring him not to let any thought of his family intervene
        to quench his resolution or to deter him from sealing his faith with
        his blood. St. Perpetua, an only daughter, a young mother of
        twenty-two, had embraced the Christian creed, confessed it before her
        judges, and declared herself ready to endure for it the martyr's
        death. Again and again her father came to her in a paroxysm of agony,
        entreating her not to deprive him of the joy and the consolation of
        his closing years. He appealed to her by the memory of all the
        tenderness he had lavished upon her—by her infant child—by his own
        gray hairs, that were soon to be brought down in sorrow to the grave.
        Forgetting in his deep anguish all the dignity of a parent, he fell
        upon his knees before his child, covered her hands with kisses, and,
        with tears streaming from his eyes, implored her to have mercy upon
        him. But she was unshaken though not untouched; she saw her father,
        frenzied with grief, dragged from before the tribunal; she saw him
        tearing his white beard, and lying prostrate and broken-hearted on
        the prison floor; she went forth to die for a faith she loved more
        dearly—for a faith that told her that her father would be lost for
        ever.<a id="noteref_739" name="noteref_739" href=

        desire for martyrdom became at times a form of absolute madness, a
        kind of epidemic of suicide, and the leading minds of the Church
        found it necessary to exert all their authority to prevent their
        followers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page392">[pg

        Tertullian mentions how, in a little Asiatic town, the entire
        population once flocked to the proconsul, declaring themselves to be
        Christians, and imploring him to execute the decree of the emperor
        and grant them the privilege of martyrdom. The bewildered functionary
        asked them whether, if they were so weary of life, there were no
        precipices or ropes by which they could end their days; and he put to
        death a small number of the suppliants, and dismissed the
        others.<a id="noteref_741" name="noteref_741" href=

        the degenerate Christians of Syria, and which were at once the
        presage and the explanation of his triumph. Such words might with
        equal propriety have been employed by the early Christian leaders to
        their Pagan adversaries. The zeal of the Christians and of the Pagans
        differed alike in degree and in kind. When Constantine made
        Christianity the religion of the State, it is probable that its
        adherents were but a minority in Rome. Even in the days of Theodosius
        the senate was still wedded to Paganism;<a id="noteref_745" name=
        "noteref_745" href="#note_745"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">745</span></span></a> yet the
        measures of Constantine were both natural and necessary. The majority
        were without inflexible belief, without moral enthusiasm, without
        definite organisation, without any of those principles that inspire
        the heroism either of resistance or aggression. The minority formed a
        serried phalanx, animated by every motive that could purify,
        discipline, and sustain their zeal. When once the Christians had
        acquired a considerable position, the question of their destiny was a
        simple one. They must either be crushed or they must reign. The
        failure of the persecution of Diocletian conducted them inevitably to
        the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may indeed be
        confidently asserted that the conversion of the Roman Empire is so
        far from being of the nature of a miracle or suspension of the
        ordinary principles of human nature, that there is scarcely any other
        great movement on record in which the causes and effects so
        manifestly correspond. The apparent anomalies of history are not
        inconsiderable, but they must be sought for in other quarters. That
        within the narrow limits and scanty population of the Greek States
        should have arisen men who, in almost every conceivable form of
        genius, in philosophy, in epic, dramatic and lyric poetry, in written
        and spoken eloquence, in statesmanship, in sculpture, in painting,
        and probably also in music, should have <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page394">[pg 394]</span><a name="Pg394" id="Pg394" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> attained almost or altogether the highest
        limits of human perfection—that the creed of Mohammed should have
        preserved its pure monotheism and its freedom from all idolatrous
        tendencies, when adopted by vast populations in that intellectual
        condition in which, under all other creeds, a gross and material
        worship has proved inevitable, both these are facts which we can only
        very imperfectly explain. Considerations of climate, and still more
        of political, social, and intellectual customs and institutions, may
        palliate the first difficulty, and the attitude Mohammed assumed to
        art may supply us with a partial explanation of the second; but I
        suppose that, after all has been said, most persons will feel that
        they are in presence of phenomena very exceptional and astonishing.
        The first rise of Christianity in Judæa is a subject wholly apart
        from this book. We are examining only the subsequent movement in the
        Roman Empire. Of this movement it may be boldly asserted that the
        assumption of a moral or intellectual miracle is utterly gratuitous.
        Never before was a religious transformation so manifestly inevitable.
        No other religion ever combined so many forms of attraction as
        Christianity, both from its intrinsic excellence, and from its
        manifest adaptation to the special wants of the time. One great cause
        of its success was that it produced more heroic actions and formed
        more upright men than any other creed; but that it should do so was
        precisely what might have been expected.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To these
        reasonings, however, those who maintain that the triumph of
        Christianity in Rome is naturally inexplicable, reply by pointing to
        the persecutions which Christianity had to encounter. As this subject
        is one on which many misconceptions exist, and as it is of extreme
        importance on account of its connection with later persecutions, it
        will be necessary briefly to discuss it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is manifest
        that the reasons that may induce a ruler to suppress by force some
        forms of religious worship or opinion, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page395">[pg 395]</span><a name="Pg395" id="Pg395" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> are very various. He may do so on moral
        grounds, because they directly or indirectly produce immorality; or
        on religious grounds, because he believes them to be offensive to the
        Deity; or on political grounds, because they are injurious either to
        the State or to the Government; or on corrupt grounds, because he
        desires to gratify some vindictive or avaricious passion. From the
        simple fact, therefore, of a religious persecution we cannot at once
        infer the principles of the persecutor, but must examine in detail by
        which of the above motives, or by what combination of them, he has
        been actuated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now, the
        persecution which has taken place at the instigation of the Christian
        priests differs in some respects broadly from all others. It has been
        far more sustained, systematic, and unflinching. It has been directed
        not merely against acts of worship, but also against speculative
        opinions. It has been supported not merely as a right, but also as a
        duty. It has been advocated in a whole literature of theology, by the
        classes that are especially devout, and by the most opposing sects,
        and it has invariably declined in conjunction with a large portion of
        theological dogmas.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have elsewhere
        examined in great detail the history of persecutions by Christians,
        and have endeavoured to show that, while exceptional causes have
        undoubtedly occasionally occurred, they were, in the overwhelming
        majority of cases, simply the natural, legitimate, and inevitable
        consequence of a certain portion of the received theology. That
        portion is the doctrine that correct theological opinions are
        essential to salvation, and that theological error necessarily
        involves guilt. To these two opinions may be distinctly traced almost
        all the sufferings that Christian persecutors have caused, almost all
        the obstructions they have thrown in the path of human progress; and
        those sufferings have been so grievous that it may be reasonably
        questioned whether superstition has not often proved a greater curse
        than vice, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page396">[pg
        396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        that obstruction was so pertinacious, that the contraction of
        theological influence has been at once the best measure, and the
        essential condition of intellectual advance. The notion that he might
        himself be possibly mistaken in his opinions, which alone could cause
        a man who was thoroughly imbued with these principles to shrink from
        persecuting, was excluded by the theological virtue of faith, which,
        whatever else it might involve, implied at least an absolute unbroken
        certainty, and led the devotee to regard all doubt, and therefore all
        action based upon doubt, as sin.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To this general
        cause of Christian persecution I have shown that two subsidiary
        influences may be joined. A large portion of theological ethics was
        derived from writings in which religious massacres, on the whole the
        most ruthless and sanguinary upon record, were said to have been
        directly enjoined by the Deity, in which the duty of suppressing
        idolatry by force was given a greater prominence than any article of
        the moral code, and in which the spirit of intolerance has found its
        most eloquent and most passionate expressions.<a id="noteref_746"
        name="noteref_746" href="#note_746"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">746</span></span></a> Besides
        this, the destiny theologians represented as awaiting the misbeliever
        was so ghastly and so appalling as to render it almost childish to
        lay any stress upon the earthly suffering that might be inflicted in
        the extirpation of error.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That these are the
        true causes of the great bulk of Christian persecution, I believe to
        be one of the most certain as well as one of the most important facts
        in history. For the detailed proof I can only refer to what I have
        elsewhere written; but I may here notice that that proof combines
        every conceivable kind of evidence that in such a question can be
        demanded. It can be shown that these principles would naturally lead
        men to persecute. It can be shown that from the time of Constantine
        to the time when the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg
        397]</span><a name="Pg397" id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        rationalistic spirit wrested the bloodstained sword from the priestly
        hand, persecution was uniformly defended upon them—defended in long,
        learned, and elaborate treatises, by the best and greatest men the
        Church had produced, by sects that differed on almost all other
        points, by multitudes who proved in every conceivable manner the
        purity of their zeal. It can be shown, too, that toleration began
        with the distinction between fundamental and non-fundamental
        doctrines, expanded in exact proportion to the growing
        latitudinarianism, and triumphed only when indifference to dogma had
        become a prevailing sentiment among legislators. It was only when the
        battle had been won—when the anti-dogmatic party, acting in
        opposition to the Church, had rendered persecution impossible—that
        the great body of theologians revised their arguments, and discovered
        that to punish men for their opinions was wholly at variance with
        their faith. With the merits of this pleasing though somewhat tardy
        conversion I am not now concerned; but few persons, I think, can
        follow the history of Christian persecution without a feeling of
        extreme astonishment that some modern writers, not content with
        maintaining that the doctrine of exclusive salvation <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em> not
        to have produced persecution, have ventured, in defiance of the
        unanimous testimony of the theologians of so many centuries, to
        dispute the plain historical fact that it <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em>
        produce it. They argue that the Pagans, who did not believe in
        exclusive salvation, persecuted, and that therefore that doctrine
        cannot be the cause of persecution. The answer is that no sane man
        ever maintained that all the persecutions on record were from the
        same source. We can prove by the clearest evidence that Christian
        persecutions sprang chiefly from the causes I have alleged. The
        causes of Pagan persecutions, though different, are equally manifest,
        and I shall proceed shortly to indicate them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They were partly
        political and partly religious. The Governments in most of the
        ancient States, in the earlier <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398" id="Pg398" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> stages of their existence, undertook the
        complete education of the people; professed to control and regulate
        all the details of their social life, even to the dresses they wore,
        or the dishes that were served upon their tables; and, in a word, to
        mould their whole lives and characters into a uniform type. Hence,
        all organisations and corporations not connected with the State, and
        especially all that emanated from foreign countries, were looked upon
        with distrust or antipathy. But this antipathy was greatly
        strengthened by a religious consideration. No belief was more deeply
        rooted in the ancient mind than that good or bad fortune sprang from
        the intervention of spiritual beings, and that to neglect the sacred
        rites was to bring down calamity upon the city. In the diminutive
        Greek States, where the function of the Government was immensely
        enlarged, a strong intolerance existed, which extended for some time
        not merely to practices, but to writings and discourses. The
        well-known persecutions of Anaxagoras, Theodorus, Diagoras, Stilpo,
        and Socrates; the laws of Plato, which were as opposed to religious
        as to domestic freedom; and the existence in Athens of an
        inquisitorial tribunal,<a id="noteref_747" name="noteref_747" href=
        "#note_747"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">747</span></span></a>
        sufficiently attested it. But long before the final ruin of Greece,
        speculative liberty had been fully attained. The Epicurean and the
        Sceptical schools developed unmolested, and even in the days of
        Socrates, Aristophanes was able to ridicule the gods upon the
        stage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the earlier
        days of Rome religion was looked upon as a function of the State; its
        chief object was to make the gods auspicious to the national
        policy,<a id="noteref_748" name="noteref_748" href=
        "#note_748"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">748</span></span></a> and its
        principal ceremonies were performed at the direct command of the
        Senate. The national theory on religious matters was that the best
        religion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page399">[pg
        399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is
        always that of a man's own country. At the same time, the widest
        tolerance was granted to the religions of conquered nations. The
        temples of every god were respected by the Roman army. Before
        besieging a city, the Romans were accustomed to supplicate the
        presiding deities of that city. With the single exception of the
        Druids, whose human sacrifices it was thought a matter of humanity to
        suppress,<a id="noteref_749" name="noteref_749" href=
        "#note_749"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">749</span></span></a> and
        whose fierce rebellions it was thought necessary to crush, the
        teachers of all national religions continued unmolested by the
        conqueror.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This policy,
        however, applied specially to religious rites practised in the
        countries in which they were indigenous. The liberty to be granted to
        the vast confluence of strangers attracted to Italy during the Empire
        was another question. In the old Republican days, when the censors
        regulated with the most despotic authority the minutest affairs of
        life, and when the national religion was interwoven with every detail
        of political and even domestic transactions, but little liberty could
        be expected. When Carneades endeavoured to inculcate his universal
        scepticism upon the Romans, by arguing alternately for and against
        the same proposition, Cato immediately urged the Senate to expel him
        from the city, lest the people should be corrupted by his
        teaching.<a id="noteref_750" name="noteref_750" href=
        "#note_750"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">750</span></span></a> For a
        similar reason all rhetoricians had been banished from the
        Republic.<a id="noteref_751" name="noteref_751" href=
        "#note_751"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">751</span></span></a> The
        most remarkable, however, and at the same time the extreme expression
        of Roman intolerance that has descended to us, is the advice which
        Mæcenas is represented as having given to Octavius Cæsar, before his
        accession to the throne. <span class="tei tei-q">“Always,”</span> he
        said, <span class="tei tei-q">“and everywhere, worship the gods
        according to the rites of your country, and compel others to the same
        worship. Pursue with your hatred and with punishments <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> those who introduce foreign religions,
        not only for the sake of the gods—the despisers of whom can assuredly
        never do anything great—but also because they who introduce new
        divinities entice many to use foreign laws. Hence arise conspiracies,
        societies, and assemblies, things very unsuited to an homogeneous

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This striking
        passage exhibits very clearly the extent to which in some minds the
        intolerant spirit was carried in antiquity, and also the blending
        motives that produced it. We should be, however, widely mistaken if
        we regarded it as a picture of the actual religious policy of the
        Empire. In order to realise this, it will be necessary to notice
        separately liberty of speculation and liberty of worship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When Asinius
        Pollio founded the first public library in Rome, he placed it in the
        Temple of Liberty. The lesson which was thus taught to the literary
        classes was never forgotten. It is probable that in no other period
        of the history of the world was speculative freedom so perfect as in
        the Roman Empire. The fearless scrutiny of all notions of popular
        belief, displayed in the writings of Cicero, Seneca, Lucretius, or
        Lucian, did not excite an effort of repression. Philosophers were,
        indeed, persecuted by Domitian and Vespasian for their ardent
        opposition to the despotism of the throne,<a id="noteref_753" name=
        "noteref_753" href="#note_753"><span class=

        their own subjects they were wholly untrammelled. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg 401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The Greek writers consoled themselves for
        the extinction of the independence of their country by the reflection
        that in the sphere of intellect the meddling policy of the Greek
        States was replaced by an absolute and a majestic freedom.<a id=

        fierceness of the opposition of sects faded beneath its influence. Of
        all the speculative conflicts of antiquity, that which most nearly
        approached the virulence of later theological controversies was
        probably that between the Stoics and the Epicureans; but it is well
        worthy of notice that some of the most emphatic testimonies to the
        moral goodness of Epicurus have come from the writings of his
        opponents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the policy of
        the Roman rulers towards religious rites was very different from, and
        would at first sight appear to be in direct opposition to, their
        policy towards opinions. An old law, which Cicero mentions, expressly
        forbade the introduction of new religions,<a id="noteref_755" name=

        worship of Isis and Serapis only gained its footing after a long
        struggle, and no small amount of persecution. The gross immorality it
        sometimes favoured, its wild and abject superstition, so thoroughly
        alien to the whole character of Roman life and tradition, and also
        the organisation of its priesthood, rendered it peculiarly obnoxious
        to the Government. When the first edict of suppression was issued,
        the people hesitated to destroy a temple which seemed so venerable in
        their eyes, and the consul Æmilius Paulus dispelled their fears by
        seizing an axe and striking the first blow himself.<a id=

        the latter days of the Republic, edicts had commanded the destruction

        Anubis, and win the favours of a devout worshipper, the temple, by
        order of the emperor, was destroyed, the images were thrown into the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These measures
        represent together a considerable amount of religious repression, but
        they were produced exclusively by notions of policy or discipline.
        They grew out of that intense national spirit which sacrificed every
        other interest to the State, and resisted every form of innovation,
        whether secular or religious, that could impair the unity of the
        national type, and dissolve the discipline which the predominance of
        the military spirit and the stern government of the Republic had
        formed. They were also, in some cases, the result of moral scandals.
        When, however, it became evident that the internal condition of the
        Republic was unsuited for the Empire, the rulers frankly acquiesced
        in the change, and from the time of Tiberius, with the single
        exception of the Christians, perfect liberty of worship seems to have
        been granted to the professors of all religions in Rome.<a id=

        law upon the subject was not revoked, but it was not generally
        enforced. Sometimes the new creeds were expressly authorised.
        Sometimes they were tacitly permitted. With a single exception, all
        the religions of the world raised their heads unmolested in the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The liberty,
        however, of professing and practising a foreign worship did not
        dispense the Roman from the obligation of performing also the
        sacrifices or other religious rites of his own land. It was here that
        whatever religious fanaticism mingled with Pagan persecutions was
        displayed. Eusebius tells us that religion was divided by the Romans
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name="Pg404"
        id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> into three parts—the
        mythology, or legends that had descended from the poets; the
        interpretations or theories by which the philosophers endeavoured to
        rationalise, filter, or explain away these legends; and the ritual or
        official religious observances. In the first two spheres perfect
        liberty was accorded, but the ritual was placed under the control of
        the Government, and was made a matter of compulsion.<a id=

        order to realise the strength of the feeling that supported it, we
        must remember that the multitude firmly believed that the prosperity
        and adversity of the Empire depended chiefly upon the zeal or
        indifference that was shown in conciliating the national divinities,
        and also that the philosophers, as I have noticed in the last
        chapter, for the most part not only practised, but warmly defended,
        the official observances. The love of truth in many forms was
        exhibited among the Pagan philosophers to a degree which has never
        been surpassed; but there was one form in which it was absolutely
        unknown. The belief that it is wrong for a man in religious matters
        to act a lie, to sanction by his presence and by his example what he
        regards as baseless superstitions, had no place in the ethics of
        antiquity. The religious flexibility which polytheism had originally
        generated, the strong political feeling that pervaded all classes,
        and also the manifest impossibility of making philosophy the creed of
        the ignorant, had rendered nearly universal among philosophers a
        state of feeling which is often exhibited, but rarely openly
        professed, among ourselves.<a id="noteref_768" name="noteref_768"

        and the sceptic considered it not merely lawful, but a duty, to
        attend the observances of his country. No one did more to scatter the
        ancient superstitions than Cicero, who was himself an augur, and who
        strongly asserted the duty of complying with the national
        rites.<a id="noteref_769" name="noteref_769" href=

        as pleasing to the Divinities, but as commanded by the law,”</span>
        and that he should remember <span class="tei tei-q">“that his worship

        Epictetus, whose austere creed rises to the purest monotheism,
        teaches as a fundamental religious maxim that every man in his

        world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It should be
        remembered, too, that the Oriental custom of deifying emperors having
        been introduced into Rome, to burn incense before their statues had
        become a kind of test of loyalty. This adoration does not, it is
        true, appear to have implied any particular article of belief, and it
        was probably regarded by most men as we regard the application of the
        term <span class="tei tei-q">“Sacred Majesty”</span> to a sovereign,
        and the custom of kneeling in his presence; but it was esteemed
        inconsistent with Christianity, and the conscientious refusal of the
        Christians to comply with it aroused a feeling resembling that which
        was long produced in Christendom by the refusal of Quakers to comply
        with the usages of courts.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The obligation to
        perform the sacred rites of an idolatrous worship, if rigidly
        enforced, would have amounted, in the case of the Jews and the
        Christians, to a complete proscription. It does not, however, appear
        that the Jews were ever persecuted on this ground. They formed a
        large and influential colony in Rome. They retained undiminished, in
        the midst of the Pagan population, their exclusive habits, refusing
        not merely all religious communion, but most social intercourse with
        the idolaters, occupying a separate quarter of the city, and
        sedulously practising their distinctive rites. Tiberius, as we have
        seen, appears to have involved them in his proscription of Egyptian
        superstitions; but they were usually perfectly unmolested, or were
        molested only when their riotous conduct had attracted the attention
        of the rulers. The Government was so far from compelling them to
        perform acts contrary to their religion, that Augustus expressly
        changed the day of the distribution of corn, in order that they might
        not be reduced to the alternative of forfeiting their share, or of
        breaking the Sabbath.<a id="noteref_772" name="noteref_772" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It appears, then,
        that the old Republican intolerance had in the Empire been so
        modified as almost to have disappeared. The liberty of speculation
        and discussion was entirely unchecked. The liberty of practising
        foreign religious rites, though ostensibly limited by the law against
        unauthorised religions, was after Tiberius equally secure. The
        liberty of abstaining from the official national rites, though more
        precarious, was fully conceded to the Jews, whose jealousy of
        idolatry was in no degree inferior to that of the Christians. It
        remains, then, to examine what were the causes of the very
        exceptional fanaticism and animosity that were directed against the
        latter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first cause of
        the persecution of the Christians was the religious notion to which I
        have already referred. The <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page407">[pg
        407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        belief that our world is governed by isolated acts of Divine
        intervention, and that, in consequence, every great calamity, whether
        physical, or military, or political, may be regarded as a punishment
        or a warning, was the basis of the whole religious system of
        antiquity.<a id="noteref_773" name="noteref_773" href=
        "#note_773"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">773</span></span></a> In the
        days of the Republic every famine, pestilence, or drought was
        followed by a searching investigation of the sacred rites, to
        ascertain what irregularity or neglect had caused the Divine anger,
        and two instances are recorded in which vestal virgins were put to
        death because their unchastity was believed to have provoked a
        national calamity.<a id="noteref_774" name="noteref_774" href=
        "#note_774"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">774</span></span></a> It
        might appear at first sight that the fanaticism which this belief
        would naturally produce would have been directed against the Jews as
        strongly as against the Christians; but a moment's reflection is
        sufficient to explain the difference. The Jewish religion was
        essentially conservative and unexpansive. Although, in the passion
        for Oriental religions, many of the Romans had begun to practise its
        ceremonies, there was no spirit of proselytism in the sect; and it is
        probable that almost all who followed this religion, to the exclusion
        of others, were of Hebrew nationality. The Christians, on the other
        hand, were ardent missionaries; they were, for the most part, Romans
        who had thrown off the allegiance of their old gods, and their
        activity was so great that from a very early period the temples were
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408"
        id="Pg408" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in some districts almost
        deserted.<a id="noteref_775" name="noteref_775" href=
        "#note_775"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">775</span></span></a> Besides
        this, the Jews simply abstained from and despised the religions
        around them. The Christians denounced them as the worship of dæmons,
        and lost no opportunity of insulting them. It is not, therefore,
        surprising that the populace should have been firmly convinced that
        every great catastrophe that occurred was due to the presence of the
        enemies of the gods. <span class="tei tei-q">“If the Tiber ascends to
        the walls,”</span> says Tertullian, <span class="tei tei-q">“or if
        the Nile does not overflow the fields, if the heaven refuses its

        Earthquakes, which, on account of their peculiarly appalling, and, to
        ignorant men, mysterious nature, have played a very large part in the
        history of superstition, were frequent and terrible in the Asiatic
        provinces, and in three or four instances the persecution of the
        Christians may be distinctly traced to the fanaticism they

        of ecclesiastical history more curious than the effects of this
        belief in alternately assisting or impeding the progress of different
        Churches. In the first three centuries of Christian history, it was
        the cause of fearful sufferings to the faith; but even then the
        Christians usually accepted the theory of their adversaries, though
        they differed concerning its application. Tertullian and Cyprian
        strongly maintained, sometimes that the calamities were due to the
        anger of the Almighty against idolatry, sometimes that they were
        intended to avenge the persecution of the truth. A collection was
        early made of men who, having been hostile to the Christian faith,
        had died by some horrible <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page409">[pg
        409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        death, and their deaths were pronounced to be Divine
        punishments.<a id="noteref_778" name="noteref_778" href=
        "#note_778"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">778</span></span></a> The
        victory which established the power of the first Christian emperor,
        and the sudden death of Arius, were afterwards accepted as decisive
        proofs of the truth of Christianity, and of the falsehood of
        Arianism.<a id="noteref_779" name="noteref_779" href=
        "#note_779"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">779</span></span></a> But
        soon the manifest signs of the dissolution of the Empire revived the
        zeal of the Pagans, who began to reproach themselves for their
        ingratitude to their old gods, and who recognised in the calamities
        of their country the vengeance of an insulted Heaven. When the altar
        of Victory was removed contemptuously from the Senate, when the
        sacred college of the vestals was suppressed, when, above all, the
        armies of Alaric encircled the Imperial city, angry murmurs arose
        which disturbed the Christians in their triumph. The standing-point
        of the theologians was then somewhat altered. St. Ambrose dissected
        with the most unsparing rationalism the theory that ascribed the
        national decline to the suppression of the vestals, traced it to all
        its consequences, and exposed all its absurdities. Orosius wrote his
        history to prove that great misfortunes had befallen the Empire
        before its conversion. Salvian wrote his treatise on Providence to
        prove that the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page410">[pg
        410]</span><a name="Pg410" id="Pg410" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        barbarian invasions were a Divine judgment on the immorality of the
        Christians. St. Augustine concentrated all his genius on a great
        work, written under the impression of the invasion of Alaric, and
        intended to prove that <span class="tei tei-q">“the city of
        God”</span> was not on earth, and that the downfall of the Empire
        need therefore cause no disquietude to the Christians. St. Gregory
        the Great continually represented the calamities of Italy as warnings
        foreboding the destruction of the world. When Rome sank finally
        before the barbarian hosts, it would seem as though the doctrine that
        temporal success was the proof of Divine favour must be finally
        abandoned. But the Christian clergy disengaged their cause from that
        of the ruined Empire, proclaimed its downfall to be a fulfilment of
        prophecy and a Divine judgment, confronted the barbarian conquerors
        in all the majesty of their sacred office, and overawed them in the
        very moment of their victory. In the conversion of the uncivilised
        tribes, the doctrine of special intervention occupied a commanding
        place. The Burgundians, when defeated by the Huns, resolved, as a
        last resource, to place themselves under the protection of the Roman
        God whom they vaguely believed to be the most powerful, and the whole
        nation in consequence embraced Christianity.<a id="noteref_780" name=

        shrines, and the defeat of so many Christian armies, by the followers
        of Mohammed; the disastrous and ignominious overthrow of the
        Crusaders, who went forth protected by all the blessings of the
        Church, were unable to impair the belief. All through the middle
        ages, and for some centuries after the middle ages had passed, every
        startling catastrophe was regarded as a punishment, or a warning, or
        a sign of the approaching termination of the world. Churches and
        monasteries were built. Religious societies were founded. Penances
        were performed. Jews were massacred, and a long catalogue might be
        given of the theories by which men attempted to connect every
        vicissitude of fortune, and every convulsion of nature, with the
        wranglings of theologians. Thus, to give but a few examples: St.
        Ambrose confidently asserted that the death of Maximus was a
        consequence of the crime he had committed in compelling the
        Christians to rebuild a Jewish synagogue they had destroyed.<a id=

        emperor to the sacred images; according to the other party, by his
        sinful hesitation in extirpating idolatry.<a id="noteref_786" name=

        Sometimes, however, they were traced to the theatre, and sometimes to
        the writings of freethinkers. But gradually, and almost insensibly,
        these notions faded away. The old language is often heard, but it is
        no longer realised and operative, and the doctrine which played so
        large a part in the history of the world has ceased to exercise any
        appreciable influence upon the actions of mankind.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to
        this religious motive, which acted chiefly upon the vulgar, there was
        a political motive which rendered Christianity obnoxious to the
        educated. The Church constituted a vast, highly organised, and in
        many respects secret society, and as such was not only distinctly
        illegal, but was also in the very highest degree calculated to excite
        the apprehensions of the Government. There was no principle in the
        Imperial policy more stubbornly upheld than the suppression of all
        corporations that might be made the nuclei of revolt. The extent to
        which this policy was carried is strikingly evinced by a letter from
        Trajan to Pliny, in which the emperor forbade the formation even of a
        guild of firemen, on the ground that they would constitute an
        association and hold meetings.<a id="noteref_789" name="noteref_789"
        href="#note_789"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">789</span></span></a> In such
        a state of feeling, the existence of a vast association, governed by
        countless functionaries, shrouding its meetings and some of its
        doctrines in impenetrable obscurity, evoking a degree of attachment
        and devotion <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg
        413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        greater than could be elicited by the State, ramifying through the
        whole extent of the empire, and restlessly extending its influence,
        would naturally arouse the strongest apprehension. That it did so is
        clearly recognised by the Christian apologists, who, however, justly
        retorted upon the objectors the impossibility of showing a single
        instance in which, in an age of continual conspiracies, the numerous
        and persecuted Christians had proved disloyal. Whatever we may think
        of their doctrine of passive obedience, it is impossible not to
        admire the constancy with which they clung to it, when all their
        interests were the other way. But yet the Pagans were not altogether
        wrong in regarding the new association as fatal to the greatness of
        the Empire. It consisted of men who regarded the Roman Empire as a
        manifestation of Antichrist, and who looked forward with passionate
        longing to its destruction. It substituted a new enthusiasm for that
        patriotism which was the very life-blood of the national existence.
        Many of the Christians deemed it wrong to fight for their country.
        All of them aspired to a type of character, and were actuated by
        hopes and motives, wholly inconsistent with that proud martial ardour
        by which the triumphs of Rome had been won, and by which alone her
        impending ruin could be averted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The aims and
        principles of this association were very imperfectly understood. The
        greatest and best of the Pagans spoke of it as a hateful
        superstition, and the phrase they most frequently reiterated, when
        speaking of its members, was <span class="tei tei-q">“enemies”</span>
        or <span class="tei tei-q">“haters of the human race.”</span> Such a
        charge, directed persistently against men whose main principle was
        the supreme excellence of love, and whose charity unquestionably rose
        far above that of any other class, was probably due in the first
        place to the unsocial habits of the converts, who deemed it necessary
        to abstain from all the forms of public amusement, to refuse to
        illuminate their houses, or hang garlands from their portals in
        honour of the national <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg
        414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        triumphs, and who somewhat ostentatiously exhibited themselves as
        separate and alien from their countrymen. It may also have arisen
        from a knowledge of the popular Christian doctrine about the future
        destiny of Pagans. When the Roman learnt what fate the Christian
        assigned to the heroes and sages of his nation, and to the immense
        mass of his living fellow-countrymen, when he was told that the
        destruction of the once glorious Empire to which he belonged was one
        of the most fervent aspirations of the Church, his feelings were very
        likely to clothe themselves in such language as I have cited.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, in addition
        to the general charges, specific accusations<a id="noteref_790" name=
        "noteref_790" href="#note_790"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">790</span></span></a> of the
        grossest kind were directed against Christian morals. At a time when
        the moral standard was very low, they were charged with deeds so
        atrocious as to scandalise the most corrupt. They were represented as
        habitually, in their secret assemblies, celebrating the most
        licentious orgies, feeding on human flesh, and then, the lights
        having been extinguished, indulging in promiscuous, and especially in
        incestuous, intercourse. The persistence with which these accusations
        were made is shown by the great prominence they occupy, both in the
        writings of the apologists and in the narrations of the persecutions.
        That these charges were absolutely false will now be questioned by no
        one. The Fathers were long able to challenge their adversaries to
        produce a single instance in which any other crime than his faith was
        proved against a martyr, and they urged with a just and noble pride
        that whatever doubt there might be of the truth of the Christian
        doctrines, or of the Divine origin of the Christian miracles, there
        was at least no doubt that Christianity had transformed the
        characters of multitudes, vivified the cold heart by a new
        enthusiasm, redeemed, regenerated, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page415">[pg 415]</span><a name="Pg415" id="Pg415" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> and emancipated the most depraved of mankind.
        Noble lives, crowned by heroic deaths, were the best arguments of the
        infant Church.<a id="noteref_791" name="noteref_791" href=
        "#note_791"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">791</span></span></a> Their
        enemies themselves not unfrequently acknowledged it. The love shown
        by the early Christians to their suffering brethren has never been
        more emphatically attested than by Lucian,<a id="noteref_792" name=
        "noteref_792" href="#note_792"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        beautiful simplicity of their worship than by Pliny,<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">794</span></span></a> There
        was, it is true, another side to the picture; but even when the moral
        standard of Christians was greatly lowered, it was lowered only to
        that of the community about them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These calumnies
        were greatly encouraged by the ecclesiastical rule, which withheld
        from the unbaptised all knowledge of some of the more mysterious
        doctrines of the Church, and veiled, at least, one of its ceremonies
        in great obscurity. Vague rumours about the nature of that
        sacramental feast, to which none but the baptised Christian was
        suffered to penetrate, and which no ecclesiastic was permitted to
        explain either to the catechumens or to the world, were probably the
        origin of the charge of cannibalism; while the Agapæ or love feasts,
        the ceremony of the kiss of love, and the peculiar and, to the
        Pagans, perhaps unintelligible, language in which the Christians
        proclaimed themselves one body and fellow-members in Christ, may have
        suggested the other charges. The eager credulity with which equally
        baseless accusations against the Jews were for centuries believed,
        illustrates the readiness with which they were accepted, and the
        extremely imperfect system of police which rendered the verification
        of secret crimes very difficult, had no doubt greatly enlarged the
        sphere of calumny. But, in addition to these considerations, the
        orthodox were in some respects exceedingly unfortunate. In the eyes
        of the Pagans they <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg
        416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        were regarded as a sect of Jews; and the Jews, on account of their
        continual riots, their inextinguishable hatred of the Gentile
        world,<a id="noteref_795" name="noteref_795" href=
        "#note_795"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">795</span></span></a> and the
        atrocities that frequently accompanied their rebellions, had early
        excited the anger and the contempt of the Pagans. On the other hand,
        the Jew, who deemed the abandonment of the law the most heinous of
        crimes, and whose patriotism only shone with a fiercer flame amid the
        calamities of his nation, regarded the Christian with an implacable
        hostility. Scorned or hated by those around him, his temple levelled
        with the dust, and the last vestige of his independence destroyed, he
        clung with a desperate tenacity to the hopes and privileges of his
        ancient creed. In his eyes the Christians were at once apostates and
        traitors. He could not forget that in the last dark hour of his
        country's agony, when the armies of the Gentile encompassed
        Jerusalem, and when the hosts of the faithful flocked to its defence,
        the Christian Jews had abandoned the fortunes of their race, and
        refused to bear any part in the heroism and the sufferings of the
        closing scene. They had proclaimed that the promised Messiah, who was
        to restore the faded glories of Israel, had already come; that the
        privileges which were so long the monopoly of a single people had
        passed to the Gentile world; that the race which was once supremely
        blest was for all future time to be accursed among mankind. It is
        not, therefore, surprising that there should have arisen between the
        two creeds an animosity which Paganism could never rival. While the
        Christians viewed with too much exultation the calamities that fell
        upon the prostrate people,<a id="noteref_796" name="noteref_796"
        href="#note_796"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> through long centuries to fill to the brim, the
        Jews laboured with unwearied hatred to foment by calumnies the
        passions of the Pagan multitude.<a id="noteref_797" name=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">797</span></span></a> On the
        other hand, the Catholic Christians showed themselves extremely
        willing to draw down the sword of the persecutor upon the heretical
        sects. When the Pagans accused the Christians of indulging in orgies
        of gross licentiousness, the first apologist, while repudiating the
        charge, was careful to add, of the heretics, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Whether or not these people commit those shameful and
        fabulous acts, the putting out the lights, indulging in promiscuous
        intercourse, and eating human flesh, I know not.”</span><a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">798</span></span></a> In a
        few years the language of doubt and insinuation was exchanged for
        that of direct assertion; and, if we may believe St. Irenæus and St.
        Clement of Alexandria, the followers of Carpocrates, the Marcionites,
        and some other Gnostic sects, habitually indulged, in their secret
        meetings, in acts of impurity and licentiousness as hideous and as
        monstrous as can be conceived, and their conduct was one of the
        causes of the persecution of the orthodox.<a id="noteref_799" name=

        the most extravagant charges of the Pagan populace were reiterated by
        the Fathers in their accusations of the Gnostics. St. Epiphanius, in
        the fourth century, assures us that some of their sects were
        accustomed to kill, to dress with spices, and to eat the children
        born of their promiscuous intercourse.<a id="noteref_800" name=

        the Roman judge, in whose eyes Judaism, orthodox Christianity, and
        heresy were but slightly differing modifications of one despicable

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another cause of
        the peculiar animosity felt against the Christians was the constant
        interference with domestic life, arising from the great number of
        female conversions. The Christian teacher was early noted for his
        unrivalled skill in playing on the chords of a woman's heart.<a id=

        was given to a seductive pontiff of a somewhat later period, might

        in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name=

        as the very foundation of domestic morality, no character could
        appear more infamous or more revolting. <span class="tei tei-q">“A
        wife,”</span> said Plutarch, expressing the deepest conviction of the
        Pagan world, <span class="tei tei-q">“should have no friends but
        those of her husband; and, as the gods are the first of friends, she
        should know no gods but those whom her husband adores. Let her shut
        the door, then, against idle religions and foreign superstitions. No
        god can take pleasure in sacrifices offered by a wife without the
        knowledge of her husband.”</span><a id="noteref_804" name=

        these principles, upon which the whole social system of Paganism had
        rested, were now disregarded. Wives in multitudes deserted their
        homes to frequent the nocturnal meetings<a id="noteref_805" name=

        sect which was looked upon with the deepest suspicion, and was placed
        under the ban of the law. Again and again, the husband, as he laid
        his head on the pillow by his wife, had the bitterness of thinking
        that all her sympathies were withdrawn from him; that her affections
        belonged to an alien priesthood and to a foreign creed; that, though
        she might discharge her duties with a gentle and uncomplaining
        fidelity, he had for ever lost the power of touching <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> her heart—he was to her only as an
        outcast, as a brand prepared for the burning. Even to a Christian
        mind there is a deep pathos in the picture which St. Augustine has
        drawn of the broken-hearted husband imploring the assistance of the
        gods, and receiving from the oracle the bitter answer: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“You may more easily write in enduring characters on the
        wave, or fly with feathers through the air, than purge the mind of a

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">I have already
        noticed the prominence which the practice of exorcism had acquired in
        the early Church, the contempt with which it was regarded by the more
        philosophic Pagans, and the law which had been directed against its
        professors. It is not, however, probable that this practice, though
        it lowered the Christians in the eyes of the educated as much as it
        elevated them in the eyes of the populace, had any appreciable
        influence in provoking persecution. In the crowd of superstitions
        that were invading the Roman Empire, exorcism had a prominent place;
        all such practices were popular with the masses; the only form of
        magic which under the Empire was seriously persecuted was political
        astrology or divination with a view to discovering the successors to
        the throne, and of this the Christians were never accused.<a id=
        "noteref_807" name="noteref_807" href="#note_807"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">807</span></span></a> There
        was, however, another form of what was deemed superstition connected
        with the Church, which was regarded by Pagan philosophers with a much
        deeper feeling of aversion. To agitate the minds of men with
        religious terrorism, to fill the unknown world with hideous images of
        suffering, to govern the reason by alarming the imagination, was in
        the eyes of the Pagan world one of the most heinous of crimes.<a id=
        "noteref_808" name="noteref_808" href="#note_808"><span class=

        fears <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page421">[pg 421]</span><a name=
        "Pg421" id="Pg421" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> were to the ancients
        the very definition of superstition, and their destruction was a main
        object both of the Epicurean and of the Stoic. To men holding such
        sentiments, it is easy to perceive how obnoxious must have appeared
        religious teachers who maintained that an eternity of torture was
        reserved for the entire human race then existing in the world, beyond
        the range of their own community, and who made the assertion of this
        doctrine one of their main instruments of success.<a id="noteref_809"
        name="noteref_809" href="#note_809"><span class=

        Enquiry, among the early theologians, was much less valued than
        belief,<a id="noteref_810" name="noteref_810" href=
        "#note_810"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">810</span></span></a> and
        reason was less appealed to than fear. In philosophy the most
        comprehensive, but in theology the most intolerant, system is
        naturally the strongest. To weak women, to the young, the ignorant,
        and the timid, to all, in a word, who were doubtful of their own
        judgment, the doctrine of exclusive salvation must have come with an
        appalling power; and, as no other religion professed it, it supplied
        the Church with an invaluable vantage-ground, and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page422">[pg 422]</span><a name="Pg422" id="Pg422"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> doubtless drove multitudes into its pale.
        To this doctrine we may also, in a great degree, ascribe the agony of
        terror that was so often displayed by the apostate, whose flesh
        shrank from the present torture, but who was convinced that the
        weakness he could not overcome would be expiated by an eternity of
        torment.<a id="noteref_811" name="noteref_811" href=
        "#note_811"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">811</span></span></a> To the
        indignation excited by such teaching was probably due a law of Marcus
        Aurelius, which decreed that <span class="tei tei-q">“if any one
        shall do anything whereby the weak minds of any may be terrified by
        superstitious fear, the offender shall be exiled into an
        island.”</span><a id="noteref_812" name="noteref_812" href=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There can, indeed,
        be little doubt that a chief cause of the hostility felt against the
        Christian Church was the intolerant aspect it at that time displayed.
        The Romans were prepared to tolerate almost any form of religion that
        would tolerate others. The Jews, though quite as obstinate as the
        Christians in refusing to sacrifice to the emperor, were rarely
        molested, except in the periods immediately following their
        insurrections, because Judaism, however exclusive and unsocial, was
        still an unaggressive national faith. But the Christian teachers
        taught that all religions, except their own and that of the Jews,
        were constructed by devils, and that all who dissented from their
        Church must be lost. It was impossible that men strung to the very
        highest pitch of religious excitement, and imagining they saw in
        every ceremony and oracle the direct working of a present dæmon,
        could restrain their zeal, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg
        423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or
        respect in any degree the feelings of others. Proselytising with an
        untiring energy, pouring a fierce stream of invective and ridicule
        upon the gods on whose favour the multitude believed all national
        prosperity to depend, not unfrequently insulting the worshippers, and
        defacing the idols,<a id="noteref_813" name="noteref_813" href=
        "#note_813"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">813</span></span></a> they
        soon stung the Pagan devotees to madness, and convinced them that
        every calamity that fell upon the empire was the righteous vengeance
        of the gods. Nor was the sceptical politician more likely to regard
        with favour a religion whose development was plainly incompatible
        with the whole religious policy of the Empire. The new Church, as it
        was then organised, must have appeared to him essentially,
        fundamentally, necessarily intolerant. To permit it to triumph was to
        permit the extinction of religious liberty in an empire which
        comprised all the leading nations of the world, and tolerated all
        their creeds. It was indeed true that in the days of their distress
        the apologists proclaimed, in high and eloquent language, the
        iniquity of persecution, and the priceless value of a free worship;
        but it needed no great sagacity to perceive that the language of the
        dominant Church would be very different. The Pagan philosopher could
        not foresee the ghastly histories of the Inquisition, of the
        Albigenses, or of St. Bartholomew; but he could scarcely doubt that
        the Christians, when in the ascendant, would never tolerate rites
        which they believed to be consecrated to devils, or restrain, in the
        season of their power, a religious animosity which they scarcely
        bridled when they were weak. It needed no prophetic inspiration
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424"
        id="Pg424" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to anticipate the time, that
        so speedily arrived, when, amid the wailings of the worshippers, the
        idols and the temples were shattered, and when all who practised the
        religious ceremonies of their forefathers were subject to the penalty
        of death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There has probably
        never existed upon earth a community whose members were bound to one
        another by a deeper or a purer affection than the Christians, in the
        days of the persecution. There has probably never existed a community
        which exhibited in its dealings with crime a gentler or more
        judicious kindness, which combined more happily an unflinching
        opposition to sin with a boundless charity to the sinner, and which
        was in consequence more successful in reclaiming and transforming the
        most vicious of mankind. There has, however, also never existed a
        community which displayed more clearly the intolerance that would
        necessarily follow its triumph. Very early tradition has related
        three anecdotes of the apostle John which illustrate faithfully this
        triple aspect of the Church. It is said that when the assemblies of
        the Christians thronged around him to hear some exhortation from his
        lips, the only words he would utter were, <span class="tei tei-q">“My
        little children, love one another;”</span> for in this, he said, is
        comprised the entire law. It is said that a young man he had once
        confided to the charge of a bishop, having fallen into the ways of
        vice, and become the captain of a band of robbers, the apostle, on
        hearing of it, bitterly reproached the negligence of the pastor, and,
        though in extreme old age, betook himself to the mountains till he
        had been captured by the robbers, when, falling with tears on the
        neck of the chief, he restored him to the path of virtue. It is said
        that the same apostle, once seeing the heretic Cerinthus in an
        establishment of baths into which he had entered, immediately rushed
        forth, fearing lest the roof should fall because a heretic was
        beneath it.<a id="noteref_814" name="noteref_814" href=
        "#note_814"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">814</span></span></a> All
        that fierce hatred <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg
        425]</span><a name="Pg425" id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        which during the Arian and Donatist controversies convulsed the
        Empire, and which in later times has deluged the world with blood,
        may be traced in the Church long before the conversion of
        Constantine. Already, in the second century, it was the rule that the
        orthodox Christian should hold no conversation, should interchange
        none of the most ordinary courtesies of life, with the excommunicated
        or the heretic.<a id="noteref_815" name="noteref_815" href=
        "#note_815"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">815</span></span></a> Common
        sufferings were impotent to assuage the animosity, and the purest and
        fondest relations of life were polluted by the new intolerance. The
        Decian persecution had scarcely closed, when St. Cyprian wrote his
        treatise to maintain that it is no more possible to be saved beyond
        the limits of the Church, than it was during the deluge beyond the
        limits of the ark; that martyrdom itself has no power to efface the
        guilt of schism; and that the heretic, who for his master's cause
        expired in tortures upon the earth, passed at once, by that master's
        decree, into an eternity of torment in hell!<a id="noteref_816" name=

        in the most innocent civic festival, lest they should appear in some
        indirect way to be acquiescing in the Pagan worship. While the
        apologists were maintaining against the Pagan persecutors the duty of
        tolerance, the Sibylline books, which were the popular literature of
        the Christians, were filled with passionate anticipations of the
        violent destruction of the Pagan temples.<a id="noteref_822" name=
        "noteref_822" href="#note_822"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        sooner had Christianity mounted the throne than the policy they
        foreshadowed became ascendant. The indifference or worldly sagacity
        of some of the rulers, and the imposing number of the Pagans,
        delayed, no doubt, the final consummation; but, from the time of
        Constantine, restrictive laws were put in force, the influence of the
        ecclesiastics was ceaselessly exerted in their favour, and no
        sagacious man could fail to anticipate the speedy and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg 427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> absolute proscription of the Pagan
        worship. It is related of the philosopher Antoninus, the son of the
        Pagan prophetess Sospitra, that, standing one day with his disciples
        before that noble temple of Serapis, at Alexandria, which was one of
        the wonders of ancient art, and which was destined soon after to
        perish by the rude hands of the Christian monks, the prophetic spirit
        of his mother fell upon him. Like another prophet before another
        shrine, he appalled his hearers by the prediction of the approaching
        ruin. The time would come, he said, when the glorious edifice before
        them would be overthrown, the carved images would be defaced, the
        temples of the gods would be turned into the sepulchres of the dead,
        and a great darkness would fall upon mankind!<a id="noteref_823"
        name="noteref_823" href="#note_823"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And, besides the
        liberty of worship, the liberty of thought and of expression, which
        was the supreme attainment of Roman civilisation, was in peril. The
        new religion, unlike that which was disappearing, claimed to dictate
        the opinions as well as the actions of men, and its teachers
        stigmatised as an atrocious crime the free expression of every
        opinion on religious matters diverging from their own. Of all the
        forms of liberty, it was this which lasted the longest, and was the
        most dearly prized. Even after Constantine, the Pagans Libanius,
        Themistius, Symmachus, and Sallust enforced their views with a
        freedom that contrasts remarkably with the restraints imposed upon
        their worship, and the beautiful friendships of St. Basil and
        Libanius, of Synesius and Hypatia, are among the most touching
        episodes of their time. But though the traditions of Pagan freedom,
        and the true catholicism of Justin Martyr and Origen, lingered long,
        it was inevitable that error, being deemed criminal, should be made
        penal. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg 428]</span><a name=
        "Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The dogmatism of
        Athanasius and Augustine, the increasing power of the clergy, and the
        fanaticism of the monks, hastened the end. The suppression of all
        religions but one by Theodosius, the murder of Hypatia at Alexandria
        by the monks of Cyril, and the closing by Justinian of the schools of
        Athens, are the three events which mark the decisive overthrow of
        intellectual freedom. A thousand years had rolled away before that
        freedom was in part restored.</p>

        from the admiration due to the surpassing courage, to the pure,

        some degree palliate the conduct of the persecutors, among whom must
        be included one emperor, who was probably, on the whole, the best and
        most humane sovereign who has ever sat upon a throne, and at least
        two others, who were considerably above the average of virtue. When,
        combined with the indifference to human suffering, the thirst for
        blood, which the spectacles of the amphitheatre had engendered, they
        assuredly make the persecutions abundantly explicable. They show that
        if it can be proved that Christian persecutions sprang from the
        doctrine of exclusive salvation, the fact that the Roman Pagans, who
        did not hold that doctrine, also persecuted, need not cause the
        slightest perplexity. That the persecutions of Christianity by the
        Roman emperors, severe as they undoubtedly were, were not of such a
        continuous nature as wholly to counteract the vast moral, social, and
        intellectual agencies that were favourable to its spread, a few dates
        will show.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen that
        when the Egyptian rites were introduced into Rome, they were met by
        prompt and energetic measures of repression; that these measures were
        again and again repeated, but that at last, when they proved
        ineffectual, the governors desisted from their opposition, and the
        new worship assumed a recognised place. The history of Christianity,
        in its relation to the Government, is the reverse of <span class=

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this. Its first introduction into Rome
        appears to have been altogether unopposed. Tertullian asserts that
        Tiberius, on the ground of a report from Pontius Pilate, desired to
        enrol Christ among the Roman gods, but that the Senate rejected the
        proposal; but this assertion, which is altogether unsupported by
        trustworthy evidence, and is, intrinsically, extremely improbable, is
        now generally recognised as false.<a id="noteref_824" name=

        expelled from the city; but no Christian writer speaks of his
        co-religionists being disturbed in this reign, while all, with a
        perfect unanimity, and with great emphasis, describe Nero as the
        first persecutor. His persecution began at the close of <span class=

        directed against Christians, not ostensibly on the ground of their
        religion, but because they were falsely accused of having set fire to
        Rome, and it is very doubtful whether it extended beyond the
        city.<a id="noteref_827" name="noteref_827" href=

        Christians, but as incendiaries, it was impossible to escape from it
        by apostasy. Within the walls of Rome it raged with great fury. The

        proselytising without restraint in the great confluence of nations,
        and amid the disintegration of old beliefs, had become a formidable
        body. They were, we learn from Tacitus, profoundly unpopular; but the
        hideous tortures to which Nero subjected them, and the conviction
        that, whatever other crimes they might have committed, they were not
        guilty of setting fire to the city, awoke general pity. Some of them,
        clad in skins of wild beasts, were torn by dogs. Others, arrayed in
        shirts of pitch, were burnt alive in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        were affixed to crosses. Great multitudes perished. The deep
        impression the persecution made on the Christian mind is shown in the
        whole literature of the Sibyls, which arose soon after, in which Nero
        is usually the central figure, and by the belief, that lingered for
        centuries, that the tyrant was yet alive, and would return once more
        as the immediate precursor of Antichrist, to inflict the last great
        persecution upon the Church.<a id="noteref_830" name="noteref_830"

        at least twenty-seven years, the Church enjoyed absolute repose.
        There is no credible evidence whatever of the smallest interference
        with its freedom till the last year of the reign of Domitian; and a
        striking illustration of the fearlessness with which it exhibited
        itself to the world has been lately furnished in the discovery, near
        Rome, of a large and handsome porch leading to a Christian catacomb,
        built above ground between the reigns of Nero and Domitian, in the
        immediate neighbourhood of one of the principal highways.<a id=
        "noteref_831" name="noteref_831" href="#note_831"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        long reign of Domitian, though it may have been surpassed in
        ferocity, was never surpassed in the Roman annals in the skilfulness
        and the persistence of its tyranny. The Stoics and literary classes,
        who upheld the traditions of political freedom, and who had
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name="Pg432"
        id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> already suffered much at the
        hands of Vespasian, were persecuted with relentless animosity. Metius
        Modestus, Arulenus Rusticus, Senecio, Helvidius, Dion Chrysostom, the
        younger Priscus, Junius Mauricus, Artemidorus, Euphrates, Epictetus,
        Arria, Fannia, and Gratilla were either killed or banished.<a id=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">832</span></span></a> No
        measures, however, appear to have been taken against the Christians
        till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 95, when a short and
        apparently not very severe persecution, concerning which our
        information is both scanty and conflicting, was directed against
        them. Of the special cause that produced it we are left in much
        doubt. Eusebius mentions, on the not very trustworthy authority of
        Hegesippus, that the emperor, having heard of the existence of the
        grandchildren of Judas, the brother of Christ, ordered them to be
        brought before him, as being of the family of David, and therefore
        possible pretenders to the throne; but on finding that they were
        simple peasants, and that the promised kingdom of which they spoke
        was a spiritual one, he dismissed them in peace, and arrested the
        persecution he had begun.<a id="noteref_833" name="noteref_833" href=
        "#note_833"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">833</span></span></a> A Pagan
        historian states that, the finances of the Empire being exhausted by
        lavish expenditure in public games, Domitian, in order to replenish
        his exchequer, resorted to a severe and special taxation of the Jews;
        that some of these, in order to evade the impost, concealed their
        worship, while others, who are supposed to have been Christians, are
        described as following the Jewish rites without being professed
        Jews.<a id="noteref_834" name="noteref_834" href=
        "#note_834"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">834</span></span></a>
        Perhaps, however, the simplest explanation is the truest, and the
        persecution may be ascribed to the antipathy which a despot like
        Domitian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page433">[pg
        433]</span><a name="Pg433" id="Pg433" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        must necessarily have felt to an institution which, though it did
        not, like Stoicism, resist his policy, at least exercised a vast
        influence altogether removed from his control. St. John, who was then
        a very old man, is said to have been at this time exiled to Patmos.
        Flavius Clemens, a consul, and a relative of the emperor, was put to
        death. His wife, or, according to another account, his niece
        Domitilla, was banished, according to one account, to the island of
        Pontia, according to another, to the island of Pandataria, and many
        others were compelled to accompany her into exile.<a id="noteref_835"
        name="noteref_835" href="#note_835"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Numbers, we are told, <span class="tei tei-q">“accused of conversion
        to impiety or Jewish rites,”</span> were condemned. Some were killed,
        and others deprived of their offices.<a id="noteref_836" name=

        cessation of the persecution there are two different versions.
        Tertullian<a id="noteref_837" name="noteref_837" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">838</span></span></a> say
        that the tyrant speedily revoked his edict, and restored those who
        had been banished; but according to Lactantius these measures were
        not taken till after the death of Domitian,<a id="noteref_839" name=
        "noteref_839" href="#note_839"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg434" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> this latter statement is
        corroborated by the assertion of Dion Cassius, that Nerva, upon his
        accession, <span class="tei tei-q">“absolved those who were accused
        of impiety, and recalled the exiles.”</span><a id="noteref_840" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we consider
        the very short time during which this persecution lasted, and the
        very slight notice that was taken of it, we may fairly, I think,
        conclude that it was not of a nature to check in any appreciable
        degree a strong religious movement like that of Christianity. The
        assassination of Domitian introduces us to the golden age of the
        Roman Empire. In the eyes of the Pagan historian, the period from the
        accession of Nerva, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 96, to the death of
        Marcus Aurelius, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 180, is memorable as a
        period of uniform good government, of rapidly advancing humanity, of
        great legislative reforms, and of a peace which was very rarely
        seriously broken. To the Christian historian it is still more
        remarkable, as one of the most critical periods in the history of his
        faith. The Church entered into it considerable indeed, as a sect, but
        not large enough to be reckoned an important power in the Empire. It
        emerged from it so increased in its numbers, and so extended in its
        ramifications, that it might fairly defy the most formidable
        assaults. It remains, therefore, to be seen whether the opposition
        against which, during these eighty-four years, it had so successfully
        struggled was of such a kind and intensity that the triumph must be
        regarded as a miracle.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nearly at the
        close of this period, during the persecution of Marcus Aurelius, St.
        Melito, Bishop of Sardis, wrote a letter of expostulation to the
        emperor, in which he explicitly asserts that in Asia the persecution
        of the pious was an event which <span class="tei tei-q">“had never
        before occurred,”</span> and was the result of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“new and strange decrees;”</span> that the ancestors of
        the emperor were accustomed to honour the Christian faith
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page435">[pg 435]</span><a name="Pg435"
        id="Pg435" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“like
        other religions;”</span> and that <span class="tei tei-q">“Nero and
        Domitian alone”</span> had been hostile to it.<a id="noteref_841"
        name="noteref_841" href="#note_841"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">841</span></span></a> Rather
        more than twenty years later, Tertullian asserted, in language
        equally distinct and emphatic, that the two persecutors of the
        Christians were Nero and Domitian, and that it would be impossible to
        name a single good sovereign who had molested them. Marcus Aurelius
        himself, Tertullian refuses to number among the persecutors, and,
        even relying upon a letter which was falsely imputed to him, enrols
        him among the protectors of the Church.<a id="noteref_842" name=
        "noteref_842" href="#note_842"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">842</span></span></a> About a
        century later, Lactantius, reviewing the history of the persecutions,
        declared that the good sovereigns who followed Domitian abstained
        from persecuting, and passes at once from the persecution of Domitian
        to that of Decius. Having noticed the measures of the former emperor,
        he proceeds: <span class="tei tei-q">“The acts of the tyrant being
        revoked, the Church was not only restored to its former state, but
        shone forth with a greater splendour and luxuriance; and a period
        following in which many good sovereigns wielded the Imperial sceptre,
        it suffered no assaults from its enemies, but stretched out its hands
        to the east and to the west; ... but at last the long peace was
        broken. After many years, that hateful monster Decius arose, who
        troubled the Church.”</span><a id="noteref_843" name="noteref_843"
        href="#note_843"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">843</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have here three
        separate passages, from which we may conclusively infer that the
        normal and habitual condition of the Christians during the
        eighty-four years we are considering, and, if we accept the last two
        passages, during a much longer period, was a condition of peace, but
        that peace was not absolutely unbroken. The Christian Church, which
        was at first regarded simply as a branch of Judaism, had begun to be
        recognised as a separate body, and the Roman law professedly
        tolerated only those religions which were <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page436">[pg 436]</span><a name="Pg436" id="Pg436" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> expressly authorised. It is indeed true that
        with the extension of the Empire, and especially of the city, the
        theory, or at least the practice, of religious legislation had been
        profoundly modified. First of all, certain religions, of which the
        Jewish was one, were officially recognised, and then many others,
        without being expressly authorised, were tolerated. In this manner,
        all attempts to resist the torrent of Oriental superstitions proving
        vain, the legislator had desisted from his efforts, and every form of
        wild superstition was practised with publicity and impunity. Still
        the laws forbidding them were unrevoked, although they were suffered
        to remain for the most part obsolete, or were at least only put in
        action on the occasion of some special scandal, or of some real or
        apprehended political danger. The municipal and provincial
        independence under the Empire was, however, so large, that very much
        depended on the character of the local governor; and it continually
        happened that in one province the Christians were unmolested or
        favoured, while in the adjoining province they were severely
        persecuted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we have already
        seen, the Christians had for many reasons become profoundly obnoxious
        to the people. They shared the unpopularity of the Jews, with whom
        they were confounded, while the general credence given to the
        calumnies about the crimes said to have been perpetrated at their
        secret meetings, their abstinence from public amusements, and the
        belief that their hostility to the gods was the cause of every
        physical calamity, were special causes of antipathy. The history of
        the period of the Antonines continually manifests the desire of the
        populace to persecute, restrained by the humanity of the rulers. In
        the short reign of Nerva there appears to have been no persecution,
        and our knowledge of the official proceedings with reference to the
        religion is comprised in two sentences of a Pagan historian, who
        tells us that the emperor <span class="tei tei-q">“absolved those who
        had been convicted <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg
        437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        impiety,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“permitted no one to be
        convicted of impiety or Jewish rites.”</span> Under Trajan, however,
        some serious though purely local disturbances took place. The emperor
        himself, though one of the most sagacious, and in most respects
        humane of Roman sovereigns, was nervously jealous of any societies or
        associations among his subjects, and had propounded a special edict
        against them; but the persecution of the Christians appears to have
        been not so much political as popular. If we may believe Eusebius,
        local persecutions, apparently of the nature of riots, but sometimes
        countenanced by provincial governors, broke out in several quarters
        of the Empire. In Bithynia, Pliny the Younger was the governor, and
        he wrote a very famous letter to Trajan, in which he professed
        himself absolutely ignorant of the proceedings to be taken against
        the Christians, who had already so multiplied that the temples were
        deserted, and who were arraigned in great numbers before his
        tribunal. He had, he says, released those who consented to burn
        incense before the image of the emperor, and to curse Christ, but had
        caused those to be executed who persisted in their refusal, and who
        were not Roman citizens, <span class="tei tei-q">“not doubting that a
        pertinacious obstinacy deserved punishment.”</span> He had questioned
        the prisoners as to the nature of their faith, and had not hesitated
        to seek revelations by torturing two maid-servants, but had
        <span class="tei tei-q">“discovered nothing but a base and immoderate
        superstition.”</span> He had asked the nature of their secret
        services, and had been told that they assembled on a certain day
        before dawn to sing a hymn to Christ as to a god; that they made a
        vow to abstain from every crime, and that they then, before parting,
        partook together of a harmless feast, which, however, they had given
        up since the decree against associations. To this letter Trajan
        answered that Christians, if brought before the tribunals and
        convicted, should be punished, but that they should not be sought
        for; that, if they consented to sacrifice, no inquisition should be

        Bishop of Jerusalem, a man, it is said, one hundred and twenty years
        old, having been accused by the heretics, was tortured during several
        days, and at last crucified. Ignatius, the Bishop of Antioch, was
        arrested, brought to Rome, and, by the order of Trajan himself,
        thrown to wild beasts. Of the cause of this last act of severity we
        are left in ignorance, but it has been noticed that about this time
        Antioch had been the scene of one of those violent earthquakes which
        so frequently produced an outburst of religious excitement,<a id=
        "noteref_846" name="noteref_846" href="#note_846"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">846</span></span></a> and the
        character of Ignatius, who was passionately desirous of martyrdom,
        may have very probably led him to some act of exceptional zeal. The
        letters of the martyr prove that at Rome the faith was openly and
        fearlessly professed; the Government during the nineteen years of
        this reign never appears to have taken any initiative against the
        Christians, and, in spite of occasional local tumults, there was
        nothing resembling a general persecution.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the two
        following reigns, the Government was more decidedly favourable to the
        Christians. Hadrian, having heard that the populace at the public
        games frequently called for their execution, issued an edict in which
        he commanded that none should be punished simply in obedience to the
        outcries against them, or without a formal trial and a conviction of
        some offence against the law, and he ordered that all false accusers
        should be punished.<a id="noteref_847" name="noteref_847" href=
        "#note_847"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">847</span></span></a> His
        disposition towards the Christians was so pacific as to give rise to
        a legend that he intended to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page439">[pg 439]</span><a name="Pg439" id="Pg439" class=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">848</span></span></a> but it
        is probable that, although curious on religious matters, he regarded
        Christianity with the indifference of a Roman freethinker; and a
        letter is ascribed to him in which he confounded it with the worship
        of Serapis.<a id="noteref_849" name="noteref_849" href=
        "#note_849"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">849</span></span></a> As far
        as the Government were concerned, the Christians appear to have been
        entirely unmolested; but many of them suffered dreadful tortures at
        the hands of the Jewish insurgents, who in this reign, with a
        desperate but ill-fated heroism, made one last effort to regain their
        freedom.<a id="noteref_850" name="noteref_850" href=
        "#note_850"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">850</span></span></a> The
        mutual hostility exhibited at this time by the Jews and Christians
        contributed to separate them in the eyes of the Pagans, and it is
        said that when Hadrian forbade the Jews ever again to enter
        Jerusalem, he recognised the distinction by granting a full
        permission to the Christians.<a id="noteref_851" name="noteref_851"
        href="#note_851"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Antoninus, who
        succeeded Hadrian, made new efforts to restrain the passions of the
        people against the Christians. He issued an edict commanding that
        they should not be molested, and when, as a consequence of some
        earthquakes in Asia Minor, the popular anger was fiercely roused, he
        commanded that their accusers should be punished.<a id="noteref_852"
        name="noteref_852" href="#note_852"><span class=

        except these riots, the twenty-three years of his reign appear to
        have been years of absolute peace, which seems also to have continued
        during several years of the reign of Marcus <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page440">[pg 440]</span><a name="Pg440" id="Pg440" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Aurelius; but at last persecuting edicts, of
        the exact nature of which we have no knowledge, were issued. Of the
        reasons which induced one of the best men who have ever reigned to
        persecute the Christians, we know little or nothing. That it was not
        any ferocity of disposition or any impatience of resistance may be
        confidently asserted of one whose only fault was a somewhat excessive
        gentleness—who, on the death of his wife, asked the Senate, as a
        single favour, to console him by sparing the lives of those who had
        rebelled against him. That it was not, as has been strangely urged, a
        religious fanaticism resembling that which led St. Lewis to
        persecute, is equally plain. St. Lewis persecuted because he believed
        that to reject his religious opinions was a heinous crime, and that
        heresy was the path to hell. Marcus Aurelius had no such belief, and
        he, the first Roman emperor who made the Stoical philosophy his
        religion and his comfort, was also the first emperor who endowed the
        professors of the philosophies that were most hostile to his own. The
        fact that the Christian Church, existing as a State within a State,
        with government, ideals, enthusiasms, and hopes wholly different from
        those of the nation, was incompatible with the existing system of the
        Empire, had become more evident as the Church increased. The
        accusations of cannibalism and incestuous impurity had acquired a
        greater consistency, and the latter are said to have been justly
        applicable to the Carpocratian heretics, who had recently arisen. The
        Stoicism of Marcus Aurelius may have revolted from the practices of
        exorcism or the appeals to the terrors of another world, and the
        philosophers who surrounded him probably stimulated his hostility,
        for his master and friend Fronto had written a book against
        Christianity,<a id="noteref_853" name="noteref_853" href=
        "#note_853"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">853</span></span></a> while
        Justin Martyr is said to have perished by the machinations of the
        Cynic Crescens.<a id="noteref_854" name="noteref_854" href=
        "#note_854"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">854</span></span></a> It must
        be added, too, that, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg
        441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        while it is impossible to acquit the emperor of having issued severe
        edicts against the Christians,<a id="noteref_855" name="noteref_855"
        href="#note_855"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">855</span></span></a> the
        atrocious details of the persecutions in his reign were due to the
        ferocity of the populace and the weakness of the governors in distant
        provinces; and it is inconceivable that, if he had been a very bitter
        enemy of the Christians, Tertullian, writing little more than twenty
        years later, should have been so ignorant of the fact as to represent
        him as one of the most conspicuous of their protectors.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, whatever may
        be thought on these points, there can, unhappily, be no question that
        in this reign Rome was stained by the blood of Justin Martyr, the
        first philosopher, and one of the purest and gentlest natures in the
        Church, and that persecution was widely extended. In two far distant
        quarters, at Smyrna and at Lyons, it far exceeded in atrocity any
        that Christianity had endured since Nero, and in each case a heroism
        of the most transcendent order was displayed by the martyrs. The
        persecution at Smyrna, in which St. Polycarp and many others most
        nobly died, took place on the occasion of the public games, and we
        may trace the influence of the Jews in stimulating it.<a id=
        "noteref_856" name="noteref_856" href="#note_856"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">856</span></span></a> The
        persecution at Lyons, which was one of the most atrocious in the
        whole compass of ecclesiastical history, and which has supplied the
        martyrology with some of its grandest and most pathetic figures,
        derived its worst features from a combination of the fury of the
        populace and of the subserviency of the governor.<a id="noteref_857"
        name="noteref_857" href="#note_857"><span class=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">857</span></span></a> Certain
        servants of the Christians, terrified by the prospect of torture,
        accused their masters of all the crimes which popular report
        attributed to them, of incest, of infanticide, of cannibalism, of
        hideous impurity. A fearful outburst of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page442">[pg 442]</span><a name="Pg442" id="Pg442" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> ferocity ensued. Tortures almost too horrible
        to recount were for hours and even days applied to the bodies of old
        men and of weak women, who displayed amid their agonies a nobler
        courage than has ever shone upon a battle-field, and whose memories
        are immortal among mankind. Blandina and Pothinus wrote in blood the
        first page of the glorious history of the Church of France.<a id=

        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">858</span></span></a> But
        although, during the closing years of Marcus Aurelius, severe
        persecutions took place in three or four provinces, there was no
        general and organised effort to suppress Christianity throughout the
        Empire.<a id="noteref_859" name="noteref_859" href=
        "#note_859"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">859</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We may next
        consider, as a single period, the space of time that elapsed from the
        death of Marcus Aurelius, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 180, to the accession
        of Decius, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 249. During all this
        time Christianity was a great and powerful body, exercising an
        important influence, and during a great part of it Christians filled
        high civil and military positions. The hostility manifested towards
        them began now to assume a more political complexion than it had
        previously done, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page443">[pg
        443]</span><a name="Pg443" id="Pg443" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        except perhaps in the later years of Marcus Aurelius. The existence
        of a vast and rapidly increasing corporation, very alien to the
        system of the Empire, confronted every ruler. Emperors like Commodus
        or Heliogabalus were usually too immersed in selfish pleasures to
        have any distinct policy; but sagacious sovereigns, sincerely
        desiring the well-being of the Empire, either, like Marcus Aurelius
        and Diocletian, endeavoured to repress the rising creed, or, like
        Alexander Severus, and at last Constantine, actively encouraged it.
        The measures Marcus Aurelius had taken against Christianity were
        arrested under Commodus, whose favourite mistress, Marcia, supplies
        one of the very few recorded instances of female influence, which has
        been the cause of so much persecution, being exerted in behalf of
        toleration;<a id="noteref_860" name="noteref_860" href=
        "#note_860"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">860</span></span></a> yet a
        Christian philosopher named Apollonius, and at the same time, by a
        curious retribution, his accuser, were in this reign executed at
        Rome.<a id="noteref_861" name="noteref_861" href=
        "#note_861"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">861</span></span></a> During
        the sixty-nine years we are considering, the general peace of the
        Church was only twice broken. The first occasion was in the reign of
        Septimus Severus, who was for some time very favourable to the
        Christians, but who, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 202 or 203, issued an
        edict, forbidding any Pagan to join the Christian or Jewish
        faith;<a id="noteref_862" name="noteref_862" href=
        "#note_862"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">862</span></span></a> and
        this edict was followed by a sanguinary persecution <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page444">[pg 444]</span><a name="Pg444" id="Pg444"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in Africa and Syria, in which the father
        of Origen, and also St. Felicitas and St. Perpetua, perished. This
        persecution does not appear to have extended to the West, and was
        apparently rather the work of provincial governors, who interpreted
        the Imperial edict as a sign of hostility to the Christians, than the
        direct act of the emperor,<a id="noteref_863" name="noteref_863"
        href="#note_863"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">863</span></span></a> whose
        decree applied only to Christians actively proselytising. It is
        worthy of notice that Origen observed that previous to this time the
        number of Christian martyrs had been very small.<a id="noteref_864"
        name="noteref_864" href="#note_864"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">864</span></span></a> The
        second persecution was occasioned by the murder of Alexander Severus
        by Maximinus. The usurper pursued with great bitterness the leading
        courtiers of the deceased emperor, among whom were some Christian
        bishops,<a id="noteref_865" name="noteref_865" href=
        "#note_865"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">865</span></span></a> and
        about the same time severe earthquakes in Pontus and Cappadocia
        produced the customary popular ebullitions. But with these exceptions
        the Christians were undisturbed. Caracalla, Macrinus, and
        Heliogabalus took no measures against them, while Alexander Severus,
        who reigned for thirteen years, warmly and steadily supported them. A
        Pagan historian assures us that this emperor intended to build
        temples in honour of Christ, but was dissuaded by the priests, who
        urged that all the other temples would be deserted. He venerated in
        his private oratory the statues of Apollonius of Tyana, Abraham,
        Orpheus, and Christ. He decreed that the provincial governors should
        not be appointed till the people had the opportunity of declaring any
        crime they had committed, borrowing this rule avowedly from the
        procedure <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg
        445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the Jews and Christians in electing their clergy; he ordered the
        precept <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not unto others what you would
        not that they should do unto you”</span> to be engraven on the palace
        and other public buildings, and he decided a dispute concerning a
        piece of ground which the Christians had occupied, and which the
        owners of certain eating-houses claimed, in favour of the former, on
        the ground that the worship of a god should be most considered.<a id=
        "noteref_866" name="noteref_866" href="#note_866"><span class=

        the Arab, who reigned during the last five years of the period we are
        considering, was so favourable to the Christians that he was
        believed, though on no trustworthy evidence, to have been
        baptised.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have now
        reviewed the history of the persecutions to the year <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 249, or about two
        hundred years after the planting of Christianity in Rome. We have
        seen that, although during that period much suffering was
        occasionally endured, and much heroism displayed, by the Christians,
        there was, with the very doubtful exception of the Neronian
        persecution, no single attempt made to suppress Christianity
        throughout the Empire. Local persecutions of great severity had taken
        place at Smyrna and Lyons, under Marcus Aurelius; in Africa and some
        Asiatic provinces, under Severus; popular tumults, arising in the
        excitement of the public games, or produced by some earthquake or
        inundation, or by some calumnious accusation, were not unfrequent;
        but there was at no time that continuous, organised, and universal
        persecution by which, in later periods, ecclesiastical tribunals have
        again and again suppressed opinions repugnant to their own; and there
        was no part of the Empire in which whole generations did not pass
        away absolutely undisturbed. No martyr had fallen in Gaul or in great
        part of Asia Minor till Marcus Aurelius. In Italy, after the death of
        Nero, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg 446]</span><a name=
        "Pg446" id="Pg446" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> with the exception of
        some slight troubles under Domitian and Maximinus, probably due to
        causes altogether distinct from religion, there were, during the
        whole period we are considering, only a few isolated instances of
        martyrdom. The bishops, as the leaders of the Church, were the
        special objects of hostility, and several in different parts of the
        world had fallen; but it is extremely questionable whether any Roman
        bishop perished after the apostolic age, till Fabianus was martyred
        under Decius.<a id="noteref_867" name="noteref_867" href=
        "#note_867"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">867</span></span></a> If
        Christianity was not formally authorised, it was, like many other
        religions in a similar position, generally acquiesced in, and, during
        a great part of the time we have reviewed, its professors appear to
        have found no obstacles to their preferment in the Court or in the
        army. The emperors were for the most part indifferent or favourable
        to them. The priests in the Pagan society had but little influence,
        and do not appear to have taken any prominent part in the persecution
        till near the time of Diocletian. With the single exception of the
        Jews, no class held that doctrine of the criminality of error which
        has been the parent of most modern persecutions; and although the
        belief that great calamities were the result of neglecting or
        insulting the gods furnished the Pagans with a religious motive for
        persecution, this motive only acted on the occasion of some rare and
        exceptional catastrophe.<a id="noteref_868" name="noteref_868" href=
        "#note_868"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        prevent the publication of any heterodox works, to institute such a
        minute police inspection as to render impossible the celebration of
        the worship he desires to suppress. But nothing of this kind was
        attempted, or indeed was possible, in the period we are considering.
        With the exception of the body-guard of the emperor, almost the whole
        army, which was of extremely moderate dimensions, was massed along
        the vast frontier of the Empire. The police force was of the
        scantiest kind, sufficient only to keep common order in the streets.
        The Government had done something to encourage, but absolutely
        nothing to control, education, and parents or societies were at
        perfect liberty to educate the young as they pleased. The expansion
        of literature, by reason of the facilities which slavery gave to

        uncontrolled.<a id="noteref_869" name="noteref_869" href=

        under the tyranny of Tiberius and Domitian, political writers and
        historians who eulogised tyrannicide, or vehemently opposed the
        Empire, were persecuted; but the extreme indignation these acts
        elicited attests their rarity, and, on matters unconnected with
        politics, the liberty of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg

        word, the Church proselytised in a society in which toleration was
        the rule, and at a time when municipal, provincial, and personal
        independence had reached the highest point, when the ruling classes
        were for the most part absolutely indifferent to religious opinions,
        and when an unprecedented concourse of influences facilitated its
        progress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When we reflect
        that these were the circumstances of the Church till the middle of

        Christianity was propagated in the face of such a fierce and
        continuous persecution that no opinions could have survived it
        without a miracle, or of arguing from the history of the early Church
        that persecution never has any real efficacy in suppressing truth.
        When, in addition to the circumstances under which it operated, we
        consider the unexampled means both of attraction and of intimidation
        that were possessed by the Church, we can have no difficulty in
        understanding that it should have acquired a magnitude that would
        enable it to defy the far more serious assaults it was still destined
        to endure. That it had acquired this extension we have abundant
        evidence. The language I have quoted from Lactantius is but a feeble

        Eusebius has preserved a letter of Cornelius, Bishop of Rome,
        containing a catalogue of the officers of his Church at the time of
        the Decian persecution. It consisted of one bishop, forty-six
        presbyters, seven deacons, seven subdeacons, forty-two acolytes,
        fifty-two exorcists, readers, and janitors. The Church also supported
        more than fifteen hundred widows, and poor or suffering
        persons.<a id="noteref_875" name="noteref_875" href=

        first example of a deliberate attempt, supported by the whole
        machinery of provincial government, and extending over the entire
        surface of the Empire, to extirpate Christianity from the world. It
        would be difficult to find language too strong to paint its horrors.
        The ferocious instincts of the populace, that were long repressed,
        burst out anew, and they were not only permitted, but encouraged by
        the rulers. Far worse than the deaths which menaced those who shrank
        from the idolatrous sacrifices, were the hideous and prolonged
        tortures by which the magistrates often sought to subdue the
        constancy of the martyr, the nameless outrages that were sometimes
        inflicted on the Christian virgin.<a id="noteref_877" name=

        Church, enervated by a long peace, and deeply infected with the vices
        of the age, tottered beneath the blow. It had long since arrived at
        the period when men were Christians not by conviction, but through
        family relationship; when the more opulent Christians vied in luxury
        with the Pagans among whom they mixed, and when even the bishops
        were, in many instances, worldly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page451">[pg 451]</span><a name="Pg451" id="Pg451" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> aspirants after civil offices. It is not,
        therefore, surprising that the defection was very large. The Pagans
        marked with triumphant ridicule, and the Fathers with a burning
        indignation, the thousands who thronged to the altars at the very
        commencement of persecution, the sudden collapse of the most
        illustrious churches, the eagerness with which the offer of
        provincial governors to furnish certificates of apostasy, without
        exacting a compliance with the conditions which those certificates
        attested, was accepted by multitudes.<a id="noteref_878" name=
        "noteref_878" href="#note_878"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">878</span></span></a> The
        question whether those who abandoned the faith should afterwards be
        readmitted to communion, became the chief question that divided the
        Novatians, and one of the questions that divided the Montanists from
        the Catholics, while the pretensions of the confessors to furnish
        indulgences, remitting the penances imposed by the bishops, led to a
        conflict which contributed very largely to establish the undisputed
        ascendancy of the episcopacy. But the Decian persecution, though it
        exhibits the Church in a somewhat less noble attitude than the
        persecutions which preceded and which followed it, was adorned by
        many examples of extreme courage and devotion, displayed in not a few
        cases by those who were physically among the frailest of mankind. It
        was of a kind eminently fitted to crush the Church. Had it taken
        place at an earlier period, had it been continued for a long
        succession of years, Christianity, without a miracle, must have
        perished. But the Decian persecution fell upon a Church which had
        existed for two centuries, and it lasted less than two years.<a id=

        extort an apostasy, and, when those tortures proved vain, great

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Decian
        persecution is remarkable in Christian archæology as being, it is
        believed, the first occasion in which the Christian catacombs were
        violated. Those vast subterranean corridors, lined with tombs and
        expanding very frequently into small chapels adorned with paintings,
        often of no mean beauty, had for a long period been an inviolable
        asylum in seasons of persecution. The extreme sanctity which the
        Romans were accustomed to attach to the place of burial repelled the
        profane, and as early, it is said, as the very beginning of the third
        century, the catacombs were recognised as legal possessions of the
        Church.<a id="noteref_883" name="noteref_883" href=
        "#note_883"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">883</span></span></a> The
        Roman legislators, however unfavourable to the formation of guilds or
        associations, made an exception in favour of burial societies, or
        associations of men subscribing a certain sum to ensure to each
        member a decent burial in ground which belonged to the corporation.
        The Church is believed to have availed itself of this privilege, and
        to have attained, in this capacity, a legal existence. The tombs,
        which were originally the properties of distinct families, became in
        this manner an ecclesiastical domain, and the catacombs were, from
        perhaps the first, made something more than places of burial.<a id=

        chapels with which they abound, and which are of the smallest
        dimensions and utterly unfit for general worship, were probably
        mortuary chapels, and may have also been employed in the services
        commemorating the martyrs, while the ordinary worship was probably at
        first conducted in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page454">[pg
        454]</span><a name="Pg454" id="Pg454" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        private houses of the Christians. The decision of Alexander Severus,
        which I have already noticed, is the earliest notice we possess of
        the existence of buildings specially devoted to the Christian
        services; but we cannot tell how long before this time they may have
        existed in Rome.<a id="noteref_885" name="noteref_885" href=

        serious persecution, however, they would doubtless have to be
        abandoned; and, as a last resort, the catacombs proved a refuge from
        the persecutors.</p>

        of Gallienus, in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 260, which I have now
        very briefly noticed, was by far the most disastrous the Church had
        yet endured. With the exception of about five years in the reigns of
        Gallus and Valerian, the persecution was continuous, though it varied
        much in its intensity and its range. During the first portion, if
        measured, not by the number of deaths, but by the atrocity of the
        tortures inflicted, it was probably as severe as any upon record. It
        was subsequently directed chiefly against the leading clergy, and, as
        we have seen, four Roman bishops perished. In addition to the
        political reasons that inspired it, the popular fanaticism
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name="Pg456"
        id="Pg456" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> caused by great calamities,
        which were ascribed to anger of the gods at the neglect of their
        worship, had in this as in former periods a great influence.
        Political disasters, which foreshadowed clearly the approaching
        downfall of the Empire, were followed by fearful and general famines
        and plagues. St. Cyprian, in a treatise addressed to one of the
        persecutors who was most confident in ascribing these things to the
        Christians, presents us with an extremely curious picture both of the
        general despondency that had fallen upon the Empire, and of the
        manner in which these calamities were regarded by the Christians.
        Like most of his co-religionists, the saint was convinced that the
        closing scene of the earth was at hand. The decrepitude of the world,
        he said, had arrived, the forces of nature were almost exhausted, the
        sun had no longer its old lustre, or the soil its old fertility, the
        spring time had grown less lovely, and the autumn less bounteous, the
        energy of man had decayed, and all things were moving rapidly to the
        end. Famines and plagues were the precursors of the day of judgment.
        They were sent to warn and punish a rebellious world, which, still
        bowing down before idols, persecuted the believers in the truth.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“So true is this, that the Christians are
        never persecuted without the sky manifesting at once the Divine
        displeasure.”</span> The conception of a converted Empire never
        appears to have flashed across the mind of the saint;<a id=
        "noteref_894" name="noteref_894" href="#note_894"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">894</span></span></a> the
        only triumph he predicted for the Church was that of another world;
        and to the threats of the persecutors he rejoined by fearful menaces.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“A burning, scorching fire will for ever
        torment those who are condemned; there will be no respite or end to
        their torments. We shall through eternity contemplate in their
        agonies those who for a short time contemplated us in tortures, and
        for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page457">[pg 457]</span><a name=
        "Pg457" id="Pg457" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> brief pleasure which
        the barbarity of our persecutors took in feasting their eyes upon an
        inhuman spectacle, they will be themselves exposed as an eternal
        spectacle of agony.”</span> As a last warning, calamity after
        calamity broke upon the world, and, with the solemnity of one on whom
        the shadow of death had already fallen, St. Cyprian adjured the
        persecutors to repent and to be saved.<a id="noteref_895" name=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The accession of
        Gallienus introduced the Church to a new period of perfect peace,
        which, with a single inconsiderable exception, continued for no less
        than forty years. The exception was furnished by Aurelian, who during
        nearly the whole of his reign had been exceedingly favourable to the
        Christians, and had even been appealed to by the orthodox bishops,
        who desired him to expel from Antioch a prelate they had
        excommunicated for heresy,<a id="noteref_896" name="noteref_896"

        who, at the close of his reign, intended to persecute. He was
        assassinated, however, according to one account, when he was just
        about to sign the decrees; according to another, before they had been
        sent through the provinces; and if any persecution actually took
        place, it was altogether inconsiderable.<a id="noteref_897" name=

        Christianity, during all this time, was not only perfectly free, it
        was greatly honoured. Christians were appointed governors of the
        provinces, and were expressly exonerated from the duty of
        sacrificing. The bishops were treated by the civil authorities with
        profound respect. The palaces of the emperor were filled with
        Christian servants, who were authorised freely to profess their
        religion, and were greatly valued for their fidelity. The popular
        prejudice seems to have been lulled to rest; and it has been noticed
        that the rapid progress of the faith excited no tumult or hostility.
        Spacious churches <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page458">[pg
        458]</span><a name="Pg458" id="Pg458" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        were erected in every quarter, and they could scarcely contain the
        multitude of worshippers.<a id="noteref_898" name="noteref_898" href=
        "#note_898"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">898</span></span></a> In Rome
        itself, before the outburst of the Diocletian persecution, there were
        no less than forty churches.<a id="noteref_899" name="noteref_899"
        href="#note_899"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        Christians may still have been outnumbered by the Pagans; but when we
        consider their organisation, their zeal, and their rapid progress, a
        speedy triumph appeared inevitable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But before that
        triumph was achieved a last and a terrific ordeal was to be
        undergone. Diocletian, whose name has been somewhat unjustly
        associated with a persecution, the responsibility of which belongs
        far more to his colleague Galerius, having left the Christians in
        perfect peace for nearly eighteen years, suffered himself to be
        persuaded to make one more effort to eradicate the foreign creed.
        This emperor, who had risen by his merits from the humblest position,
        exhibited in all the other actions of his reign a moderate, placable,
        and conspicuously humane nature, and, although he greatly magnified
        the Imperial authority, the simplicity of his private life, his
        voluntary abdication, and, above all, his singularly noble conduct
        during many years of retirement, displayed a rare magnanimity of
        character. As a politician, he deserves, I think, to rank very high.
        Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius had been too fascinated by the
        traditions of the Republic, and by the austere teaching and
        retrospective spirit of the Stoics, to realise the necessity of
        adapting institutions to the wants of a luxurious and highly
        civilised people, and they therefore had little permanent influence
        upon the destinies of the Empire. But Diocletian invariably exhibited
        in his legislation a far-seeing and comprehensive mind, well aware of
        the condition of the society he ruled, and provident of distant
        events. Perceiving that Roman corruption was incurable, he attempted
        to regenerate <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page459">[pg
        459]</span><a name="Pg459" id="Pg459" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        Empire by creating new centres of political life in the great and
        comparatively unperverted capitals of the provinces; and Nicomedia,
        which was his habitual residence, Carthage, Milan, and Ravenna, all
        received abundant tokens of his favour. He swept away or disregarded
        the obsolete and inefficient institutions of Republican liberty that
        still remained, and indeed gave his government a somewhat Oriental
        character; but, at the same time, by the bold, and, it must be
        admitted, very perilous measure of dividing the Empire into four
        sections, he abridged the power of each ruler, ensured the better
        supervision and increased authority of the provinces, and devised the
        first effectual check to those military revolts which had for some
        time been threatening the Empire with anarchy. With the same
        energetic statesmanship, we find him reorganising the whole system of
        taxation, and attempting, less wisely, to regulate commercial
        transactions. To such an emperor, the problem presented by the rapid
        progress and the profoundly anti-national character of Christianity
        must have been a matter of serious consideration, and the weaknesses
        of his character were most unfavourable to the Church; for
        Diocletian, with many noble qualities of heart and head, was yet
        superstitious, tortuous, nervous, and vacillating, and was too
        readily swayed by the rude and ferocious soldier, who was impetuously
        inciting him against the Christians.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The extreme
        passion which Galerius displayed on this subject is ascribed, in the
        first instance, to the influence of his mother, who was ardently
        devoted to the Pagan worship. He is himself painted in dark colours
        by the Christian writers as a man of boundless and unbridled
        sensuality, of an imperiousness that rose to fury at opposition, and
        of a cruelty which had long passed the stage of callousness, and
        become a fiendish delight, in the infliction and contemplation of
        suffering.<a id="noteref_900" name="noteref_900" href=
        "#note_900"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">900</span></span></a> His
        strong attachment to Paganism made him at <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page460">[pg 460]</span><a name="Pg460" id="Pg460" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> length the avowed representative of his party,
        which several causes had contributed to strengthen. The philosophy of
        the Empire had by this time fully passed into its Neoplatonic and
        Pythagorean phases, and was closely connected with religious
        observances. Hierocles and Porphyry, who were among its most eminent
        exponents, had both written books against Christianity, and the
        Oriental religions fostered much fanaticism among the people.
        Political interests united with superstition, for the Christians were
        now a very formidable body in the State. Their interests were
        supposed to be represented by the Cæsar Constantius Chlorus, and the
        religion was either adopted, or at least warmly favoured, by the wife
        and daughter of Diocletian (the latter of whom was married to
        Galerius<a id="noteref_901" name="noteref_901" href=
        "#note_901"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">901</span></span></a>), and
        openly professed by some of the leading officials at the Court. A
        magnificent church crowned the hill facing the palace of the emperor
        at Nicomedia. The bishops were, in most cities, among the most active
        and influential citizens, and their influence was not always
        exercised for good. A few cases, in which an ill-considered zeal led
        Christians to insult the Pagan worship, one or two instances of
        Christians refusing to serve in the army, because they believed
        military life repugnant to their creed, a scandalous relaxation of
        morals, that had arisen during the long peace, and the fierce and
        notorious discord displayed by the leaders of the Church, contributed
        in different ways to accelerate the persecution.<a id="noteref_902"
        name="noteref_902" href="#note_902"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">902</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For a considerable
        time Diocletian resisted all the urgency of Galerius against the
        Christians, and the only measure taken was the dismissal by the
        latter sovereign of a number of Christian officers from the army. In
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 303, however,
        Diocletian yielded to the entreaties of his colleague, and a fearful
        persecution, which many circumstances conspired to stimulate, began.
        The priests, in one of the public ceremonies, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page461">[pg 461]</span><a name="Pg461" id="Pg461"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had declared that the presence of
        Christians prevented the entrails from showing the accustomed signs.
        The oracle of Apollo, at Miletus, being consulted by Diocletian,
        exhorted him to persecute the Christians. A fanatical Christian, who
        avowed his deed, and expiated it by a fearful death, tore down the
        first edict of persecution, and replaced it by a bitter taunt against
        the emperor. Twice, after the outburst of the persecution, the palace
        at Nicomedia, where Diocletian and Galerius were residing, was set on
        fire, and the act was ascribed, not without probability, to a
        Christian hand, as were also some slight disturbances that afterwards
        arose in Syria.<a id="noteref_903" name="noteref_903" href=
        "#note_903"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">903</span></span></a> Edict
        after edict followed in rapid succession. The first ordered the
        destruction of all Christian churches and of all Bibles, menaced with
        death the Christians if they assembled in secret for Divine worship,
        and deprived them of all civil rights. A second edict ordered all
        ecclesiastics to be thrown into prison, while a third edict ordered
        that these prisoners, and a fourth edict that all Christians, should
        be compelled by torture to sacrifice. At first Diocletian refused to
        permit their lives to be taken, but after the fire at Nicomedia this
        restriction was removed. Many were burnt alive, and the tortures by
        which the persecutors sought to shake their resolution were so
        dreadful that even such a death seemed an act of mercy. The only
        province of the Empire where the Christians were at peace was Gaul,
        which had received its baptism of blood under Marcus Aurelius, but
        was now governed by Constantius Chlorus, who protected them from
        personal molestation, though he was compelled, in obedience to the
        emperor, to destroy their churches. In Spain, which was also under
        the government, but not under the direct inspection, of Constantius,
        the persecution was moderate, but in all other parts of the Empire it
        raged with <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page462">[pg
        462]</span><a name="Pg462" id="Pg462" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        fierceness till the abdication of Diocletian in 305. This event
        almost immediately restored peace to the Western provinces,<a id=

        greatly aggravated the misfortunes of the Eastern Christians, who
        passed under the absolute rule of Galerius. Horrible, varied, and
        prolonged tortures were employed to quell their fortitude, and their
        final resistance was crowned by the most dreadful of all deaths,
        roasting over a slow fire. It was not till <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span> 311, eight years after
        the commencement of the general persecution, ten years after the
        first measure against the Christians, that the Eastern persecution
        ceased. Galerius, the arch-enemy of the Christians, was struck down
        by a fearful disease. His body, it is said, became a mass of
        loathsome and fœtid sores—a living corpse, devoured by countless
        worms, and exhaling the odour of the charnel-house. He who had shed
        so much innocent blood, shrank himself from a Roman death. In his
        extreme anguish he appealed in turn to physician after physician, and
        to temple after temple. At last he relented towards the Christians.
        He issued a proclamation restoring them to liberty, permitting them
        to rebuild their churches, and asking their prayers for his
        recovery.<a id="noteref_905" name="noteref_905" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">905</span></span></a> The era
        of persecution now closed. One brief spasm, indeed, due to the Cæsar
        Maximian, shot through the long afflicted Church of Asia Minor;<a id=

        was rapidly allayed. The accession of Constantine, the proclamation
        of Milan, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        Christianity became the religion of the Empire.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, so far as we
        can trace it, is the outline of the last and most terrible
        persecution inflicted on the early Church. Unfortunately we can place
        little reliance on any information we possess about the number of its
        victims, the provocations that produced it, or the objects of its
        authors. The ecclesiastical account of these matters is absolutely
        unchecked by any Pagan statement, and it is derived almost
        exclusively from the history of Eusebius, and from the treatise
        <span class="tei tei-q">“On the Deaths of the Persecutors,”</span>
        which is ascribed to Lactantius. Eusebius was a writer of great
        learning, and of critical abilities not below the very low level of
        his time, and he had personal knowledge of some of the events in
        Palestine which he has recorded; but he had no pretensions whatever
        to impartiality. He has frankly told us that his principle in writing
        history was to conceal the facts that were injurious to the
        reputation of the Church;<a id="noteref_907" name="noteref_907" href=
        "#note_907"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">907</span></span></a> and
        although his practice was sometimes better than his principle, the
        portrait he has drawn of the saintly virtues of his patron
        Constantine, which we are able to correct from other sources,
        abundantly proves with how little scruple the courtly bishop could
        stray into the paths of fiction. The treatise of Lactantius, which
        has been well termed <span class="tei tei-q">“a party
        pamphlet,”</span> is much more untrustworthy. It is a hymn of
        exultation over the disastrous ends of the persecutors, and
        especially of Galerius, written in a strain of the fiercest and most
        passionate invective, and bearing on every page unequivocal signs of
        inaccuracy and exaggeration. The whole history of the early
        persecution was soon enveloped in a thick cloud of falsehood. A
        notion, derived from prophecy, that ten great persecutions must
        precede the day of judgment, at an early period stimulated
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page464">[pg 464]</span><a name="Pg464"
        id="Pg464" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the imagination of the
        Christians, who believed that day to be imminent; and it was natural
        that as time rolled on men should magnify the sufferings that had
        been endured, and that in credulous and uncritical ages a single real
        incident should be often multiplied, diversified, and exaggerated in
        many distinct narratives. Monstrous fictions, such as the crucifixion
        of ten thousand Christians upon Mount Ararat under Trajan, the letter
        of Tiberianus to Trajan, complaining that he was weary of ceaselessly
        killing Christians in Palestine, and the Theban legion of six
        thousand men, said to have been massacred by Maximilian, were boldly
        propagated and readily believed.<a id="noteref_908" name=
        "noteref_908" href="#note_908"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">908</span></span></a> The
        virtue supposed to attach to the bones of martyrs, and the custom,
        and, after a decree of the second Council of Nice, in the eighth
        century, the obligation, of placing saintly remains under every
        altar, led to an immense multiplication of spurious relics, and a
        corresponding demand for legends. Almost every hamlet soon required a
        patron martyr and a local legend, which the nearest monastery was
        usually ready to supply. The monks occupied their time in composing
        and disseminating innumerable acts of martyrs, which purported to be
        strictly historical, but which were, in fact, deliberate, though it
        was thought edifying, forgeries; and pictures of hideous tortures,
        enlivened by fantastic miracles, soon became the favourite popular
        literature. To discriminate accurately the genuine acts of martyrs
        from the immense mass that were fabricated by the monks, has been
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page465">[pg 465]</span><a name="Pg465"
        id="Pg465" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> attempted by Ruinart, but is
        perhaps impossible. Modern criticism has, however, done much to
        reduce the ancient persecutions to their true dimensions. The famous
        essay of Dodwell, which appeared towards the close of the seventeenth
        century, though written, I think, a little in the spirit of a special
        pleader, and not free from its own exaggerations, has had a great and
        abiding influence upon ecclesiastical history, and the still more
        famous chapter which Gibbon devoted to the subject rendered the
        conclusions of Dodwell familiar to the world.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        the great knowledge and critical acumen displayed in this chapter,
        few persons, I imagine, can rise from its perusal without a feeling
        both of repulsion and dissatisfaction. The complete absence of all
        sympathy with the heroic courage manifested by the martyrs, and the
        frigid and, in truth, most unphilosophical severity with which the
        historian has weighed the words and actions of men engaged in the
        agonies of a deadly struggle, must repel every generous nature, while
        the persistence with which he estimates persecutions by the number of
        deaths rather than by the amount of suffering, diverts the mind from
        the really distinctive atrocities of the Pagan persecutions. He has
        observed, that while the anger of the persecutors was at all times
        especially directed against the bishops, we know from Eusebius that
        only nine bishops were put to death in the entire Diocletian
        persecution, and that the particular enumeration, which the historian
        made on the spot, of all the martyrs who perished during this
        persecution in Palestine, which was under the government of Galerius,
        and was therefore exposed to the full fury of the storm, shows the
        entire number to have been ninety-two. Starting from this fact,
        Gibbon, by a well-known process of calculation, has estimated the
        probable number of martyrs in the whole Empire, during the Diocletian
        persecution, at about two thousand, which happens to be the number of
        persons burnt by the Spanish Inquisition during the <span class=

        about one twenty-fifth of the number who are said to have suffered
        for their religion in the Netherlands in the reign of Charles
        V.<a id="noteref_910" name="noteref_910" href=
        "#note_910"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">910</span></span></a> But
        although, if measured by the number of martyrs, the persecutions
        inflicted by Pagans were less terrible than those inflicted by
        Christians, there is one aspect in which the former appear by far the
        more atrocious, and a truthful historian should suffer no false
        delicacy to prevent him from unflinchingly stating it. The conduct of
        the provincial governors, even when they were compelled by the
        Imperial edicts to persecute, was often conspicuously merciful. The
        Christian records contain several examples of rulers who refused to
        search out the Christians, who discountenanced or even punished their
        accusers, who suggested ingenious evasions of the law, who tried by
        earnest and patient kindness to overcome what they regarded as insane
        obstinacy, and who, when their efforts had proved vain, mitigated by
        their own authority the sentence they were compelled to pronounce. It
        was only on very rare occasions that any, except conspicuous leaders
        of the Church, and sometimes persons of a servile condition, were in
        danger; the time that was conceded them before their trials gave them
        great facilities for escaping, and, even when condemned, Christian
        women had usually full permission to visit them in their prisons, and
        to console them by their charity. But, on the other hand, Christian
        writings, which it is impossible to dispute, continually record
        barbarities inflicted upon converts, so ghastly and so hideous that
        the worst horrors of the Inquisition <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page467">[pg 467]</span><a name="Pg467" id="Pg467" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> pale before them. It is, indeed, true that
        burning heretics by a slow fire was one of the accomplishments of the
        Inquisitors, and that they were among the most consummate masters of
        torture of their age. It is true that in one Catholic country they

        true, too, that the immense majority of the acts of the martyrs are
        the transparent forgeries of lying monks; but it is also true that
        among the authentic records of Pagan persecutions there are histories
        which display, perhaps more vividly than any other, both the depth of
        cruelty to which human nature may sink, and the heroism of resistance
        it may attain. There was a time when it was the just boast of the
        Romans, that no refinements of cruelty, no prolongations of torture,
        were admitted in their stern but simple penal code. But all this was
        changed. Those hateful games, which made the spectacle of human
        suffering and death the delight of all classes, had spread their
        brutalising influence wherever the Roman name was known, had rendered
        millions absolutely indifferent to the sight of human suffering, had
        produced in many, in the very centre of an advanced civilisation, a
        relish and a passion for torture, a rapture and an exultation in
        watching the spasms of extreme agony, such as an African or an
        American savage alone can equal. The most horrible recorded instances
        of torture were usually inflicted, either by the populace, or in
        their presence, in the arena.<a id="noteref_912" name="noteref_912"

        their half-consumed flesh rose in a suffocating cloud to heaven; of

        hundred and twenty-seven converts sent on one occasion to the mines,
        each with the sinews of one leg severed by a red-hot iron, and with
        an eye scooped from its socket; of fires so slow that the victims
        writhed for hours in their agonies; of bodies torn limb from limb, or
        sprinkled with burning lead; of mingled salt and vinegar poured over
        the flesh that was bleeding from the rack; of tortures prolonged and
        varied through entire days. For the love of their Divine Master, for
        the cause they believed to be true, men, and even weak girls, endured
        these things without flinching, when one word would have freed them
        from their sufferings. No opinion we may form of the proceedings of
        priests in a later age should impair the reverence with which we bend

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The opinions of Hume on moral
          questions are grossly misrepresented by many writers, who persist
          in describing them as substantially identical with those of
          Bentham. How far Hume was from denying the existence of a moral
          sense, the following passages will show:—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The final sentence, it is probable, which pronounces
          characters and actions amiable or odious, praiseworthy or blameable
          ... depends on some internal sense or feeling which nature has made
          universal in the whole species.”</span>—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Enquiry Concerning
          Morals</span></span>, § 1. <span class="tei tei-q">“The hypothesis
          we embrace ... defines virtue to be whatever mental action or
          quality gives to the spectator the pleasing sentiment of
          approbation.”</span>—Ibid. Append. I. <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          crime or immorality is no particular fact or relation which can be
          the object of the understanding, but arises entirely from the
          sentiment of disapprobation, which, by the structure of human
          nature, we unavoidably feel on the apprehension of barbarity or
          treachery.”</span>—Ibid. <span class="tei tei-q">“Reason instructs
          us in the several tendencies of actions, and humanity makes a
          distinction in favour of those which are useful and
          beneficial.”</span>—Ibid. <span class="tei tei-q">“As virtue is an
          end, and is desirable on its own account without fee or reward,
          merely for the immediate satisfaction it conveys, it is requisite
          that there should be some sentiment which it touches, some internal
          taste or feeling, or whatever you please to call it, which
          distinguishes moral good and evil, and which embraces the one and
          rejects the other.”</span>—Ibid. The two writers to whom Hume was
          most indebted were Hutcheson and Butler. In some interesting
          letters to the former (Burton's <span class=

          anti-Christian writer, Hobbes, was the advocate of extreme
          selfishness in morals, had, I think, a favourable influence upon
          the ethics of the church. Hobbes gave the first great impulse to
          moral philosophy in England, and his opponents were naturally
          impelled to an unselfish theory. Bishop Cumberland led the way,
          resolving virtue (like Hutcheson) into benevolence. The majority of
          divines, however, till the present century, have, I think, been on
          the selfish side.</dd>

          penalties of the law; the religious sanction by those expected from
          the ruler of the universe; and the popular, which he

          was emphatically opposed to the school of Hobbes, and even declared
          that no one could honestly and in good faith deny the reality of an
          unselfish element in man. Following in the steps of Butler, he
          explained it in the following passage:—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Hunger and thirst have eating and drinking for their
          end, and from the gratification of these primary appetites arises a
          pleasure which may become the object of another species of desire
          or inclination that is secondary and interested. In the same manner
          there are mental passions by which we are impelled immediately to
          seek particular objects, such as fame or power or vengeance,
          without any regard to interest, and when these objects are attained
          a pleasing enjoyment ensues.... Now where is the difficulty of
          conceiving that this may likewise be the case with benevolence and
          friendship, and that from the original frame of our temper we may
          feel a desire of another's happiness or good, which by means of
          that affection becomes our own good, and is afterwards pursued,
          from the combined motives of benevolence and
          self-enjoyment?”</span>—Hume's <span class=

          than anything Bentham ever wrote on morals. This last writer—whose

          should never perform an act which would not be conducive to human
          happiness if it were universally performed, or, as Mr. Austin
          expresses it, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the question is if acts

          that utility alone constitutes virtue, and if I am meditating any
          particular act, the sole question of morality must be whether that
          act is on the whole useful, produces a net result of happiness. To
          determine this question I must consider both the immediate and the
          remote consequences of the act; but the latter are not ascertained
          by asking what would be the result if every one did as I do, but by
          asking how far, as a matter of fact, my act is likely to produce
          imitators, or affect the conduct and future acts of others. It may
          no doubt be convenient and useful to form classifications based on
          the general tendency of different courses to promote or diminish
          happiness, but such classifications cannot alter the morality of
          particular acts. It is quite clear that no act which produces on
          the whole more pleasure than pain can on utilitarian principles be
          vicious. It is, I think, equally clear that no one could act
          consistently on such a principle without being led to consequences

          believe, be found that the latter is most strongly experienced by
          the very men who most sincerely disclaim all sense of merit.
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Were the perfect man to exist,”</span>
          said that good and great writer, Archer Butler, <span class=

          highest stage of advancement is the lowest descent in
          humility.”</span> At all events, the reader will observe, that on
          utilitarian principles nothing could be more pernicious or criminal
          than that modest, humble, and diffident spirit, which diminishes
          the pleasure of self-gratulation, one of the highest utilitarian
          motives to virtue.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Hartley has tried in one place to
          evade this conclusion by an appeal to the doctrine of final causes.
          He says that the fact that conscience is not an original principle
          of our nature, but is formed mechanically in the manner I have
          described, does not invalidate the fact that it is intended for our
          guide, <span class="tei tei-q">“for all the things which have
          evident final causes, are plainly brought about by mechanical
          means;”</span> and he appeals to the milk in the breast, which is
          intended for the sustenance of the young, but which is nevertheless
          mechanically produced. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">On Man</span></span>, vol. ii. pp. 338-339.)
          But it is plain that this mode of reasoning would justify us in
          attributing an authoritative character to any habit—e.g. to that of
          avarice—which these writers assure us is in the manner of its
          formation an exact parallel to conscience. The later followers of
          Hartley certainly cannot be accused of any excessive predilection
          for the doctrine of final causes, yet we sometimes find them asking
          what great difference it can make whether (when conscience is
          admitted by both parties to be real) it is regarded as an original
          principle of our nature, or as a product of association? Simply
          this. If by the constitution of our nature we are subject to a law
          of duty which is different from and higher than our interest, a man
          who violates this law through interested motives, is deserving of
          reprobation. If on the other hand there is no natural law of duty,
          and if the pursuit of our interest is the one original principle of
          our being, no one can be censured who pursues it, and the first
          criterion of a wise man will be his determination to eradicate
          every habit (conscientious or otherwise) which impedes him in doing
          so.</dd>

          that men take pleasure to behold from the shore the danger of those
          that are at sea in a tempest or in fight, or from a safe castle to
          behold two armies charge one another in the field? It is certainly
          in the whole sum joy, else men would never flock to such a
          spectacle. Nevertheless, there is both joy and grief, for as there
          is novelty and remembrance of our own security present, which is
          delight, so there is also pity, which is grief. But the delight is

          Buckle has written upon morals—I think the weakest portion of his
          great work. See, for example, an elaborate confusion on the
          subject, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          is commonly called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Scotch
          school”</span> (a school founded by the Irishman Hutcheson, and to
          which Hume does not belong), were incapable of inductive reasoning,
          because they maintained the existence of a moral sense or faculty,
          or of first principles, incapable of resolution; and he enters into
          a learned enquiry into the causes which made it impossible for
          Scotch writers to pursue or appreciate the inductive method. It is
          curious to contrast this view with the language of one, who,
          whatever may be the value of his original speculations, is, I
          conceive, among the very ablest philosophical critics of the
          present century. <span class="tei tei-q">“Les philosophes écossais
          adoptèrent les procédés que Bacon avait recommandé d'appliquer à
          l'étude du monde physique, et les transportèrent dans l'étude du
          monde moral. Ils firent voir que l'induction baconienne,
          c'est-à-dire, l'induction précédée d'une observation scrupuleuse
          des phénomènes, est en philosophie comme en physique la seule
          méthode légitime. C'est un de leurs titres les plus honorables
          d'avoir insisté sur cette démonstration, et d'avoir en même temps
          joint l'exemple au précepte.... Il est vrai que le zèle des
          philosophes écossais en faveur de la méthode d'observation leur a
          presque fait dépasser le but. Ils ont incliné à renfermer la
          psychologie dans la description minutieuse et continuelle de
          phénomènes de l'âme sans réfléchir assez que cette description doit
          faire place à l'induction et au raisonnement déductif, et qu'une
          philosophie qui se bornerait à l'observation serait aussi stérile
          que celle qui s'amuserait à construire des hypothèses sans avoir

          Dugald Stewart had said much the same thing, but he was a

          Cousin makes against Locke is, that he investigated the origin of
          our ideas before analysing minutely their nature, and the propriety
          of this method is one of the points on which Mr. Mill (<span class=

          enjoyment actually lasts, the extent to which they are dulled by
          repetition, and the cases in which they incapacitate men for other
          pleasures. But this calculation omits the influence of some animal
          enjoyments upon health and temperament. The fact, however, that

          mental pleasures are <span class="tei tei-q">“more
          ennobling”</span> than physical ones. The older utilitarians, as
          far as I have observed, did not even advert to the question. This
          being the case, it must have been a matter of surprise as well as
          of gratification to most intuitive moralists to find Mr. Mill fully
          recognising the existence of different kinds of pleasure, and
          admitting that the superiority of the higher kinds does not spring
          from their being greater in amount.—<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Utilitarianism</span></span>, pp. 11-12. If it
          be meant by this that we have the power of recognising some
          pleasures as superior to others in kind, irrespective of all
          consideration of their intensity, their cost, and their
          consequences, I submit that the admission is completely
          incompatible with the utilitarian theory, and that Mr. Mill has
          only succeeded in introducing Stoical elements into his system by
          loosening its very foundation. The impossibility of establishing an
          aristocracy of enjoyments in which, apart from all considerations
          of consequences, some which give less pleasure and are less widely
          diffused are regarded as intrinsically superior to others which
          give more pleasure and are more general, without admitting into our
          estimate a moral element, which on utilitarian principles is wholly
          illegitimate, has been powerfully shown since the first edition of
          this book by Professor Grote, in his <span class=

          ascribes the law to Romulus, and who mentions two cases in which
          women were said to have been put to death for this offence, and a
          third in which the offender was deprived of her dowry. Cato said
          that the ancient Romans were accustomed to kiss their wives for the
          purpose of discovering whether they had been drinking wine. The
          Bona Dea, it is said, was originally a woman named Fatua, who was
          famous for her modesty and fidelity to her husband, but who,
          unfortunately, having once found a cask of wine in the house, got
          drunk, and was in consequence scourged to death by her husband. He
          afterwards repented of his act, and paid divine honours to her
          memory, and as a memorial of her death, a cask of wine was always
          placed upon the altar during the rites. (Lactantius, <span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This equivocation seems to me to lie
          at the root of the famous dispute whether man is by nature a social
          being, or whether, as Hobbes averred, the state of nature is a
          state of war. Few persons who have observed the recent light thrown
          on the subject will question that the primitive condition of man
          was that of savage life, and fewer still will question that savage
          life is a state of war. On the other hand, it is, I think, equally
          certain that man necessarily becomes a social being in exact
          proportion to the development of the capacities of his nature.</dd>

          Locke. Paley then adopted it, taking a history of base ingratitude
          related by Valerius Maximus, and asking whether a savage would view
          it with disapprobation. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          himself assailed by another hunter whom he kills. Mr. Austin asks
          whether the savage would perceive a moral difference between these
          two acts of homicide? Certainly not. In this early stage of
          development, the savage recognises a duty of justice and humanity
          to the members of his tribe, but to no one beyond this circle. He
          is in a <span class="tei tei-q">“state of war”</span> with the

          metaphysics knows that there has been an almost endless controversy
          about Locke's meaning on this point. The fact seems to be that
          Locke, like most great originators of thought, and indeed more than
          most, often failed to perceive the ultimate consequences of his
          principles, and partly through some confusion of thought, and
          partly through unhappiness of expression, has left passages
          involving the conclusions of both schools. As a matter of history
          the sensual school of Condillac grew professedly out of his
          philosophy. In defence of the legitimacy of the process by which
          these writers evolved their conclusions from the premisses of
          Locke, the reader may consult the very able lectures of M. Cousin
          on Locke. The other side has been treated, among others, by Dugald

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">An important intellectual revolution
          is at present taking place in England. The ascendency in literary
          and philosophical questions which belonged to the writers of books
          is manifestly passing in a very great degree to weekly and even
          daily papers, which have long been supreme in politics, and have
          begun within the last ten years systematically to treat ethical and
          philosophical questions. From their immense circulation, their
          incontestable ability and the power they possess of continually
          reiterating their distinctive doctrines, from the impatience, too,
          of long and elaborate writings, which newspapers generate in the
          public, it has come to pass that these periodicals exercise
          probably a greater influence than any other productions of the day,
          in forming the ways of thinking of ordinary educated Englishmen.
          The many consequences, good and evil, of this change it will be the
          duty of future literary historians to trace, but there is one which
          is, I think, much felt in the sphere of ethics. An important effect
          of these journals has been to evoke a large amount of literary
          talent in the lawyer class. Men whose professional duties would
          render it impossible for them to write long books, are quite
          capable of treating philosophical subjects in the form of short
          essays, and have in fact become conspicuous in these periodicals.
          There has seldom, I think, before, been a time when lawyers
          occupied such an important literary position as at present, or when
          legal ways of thinking had so great an influence over English
          philosophy; and this fact has been eminently favourable to the
          progress of utilitarianism.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">There is a very curious discussion on
          this subject, reported to have taken place between Apollonius of
          Tyana and an Egyptian priest. The former defended the Greek fashion
          of worshipping the Divinity under the form of the human image,
          sculptured by Phidias and Praxiteles, this being the noblest form
          we can conceive, and therefore the least inadequate to the Divine
          perfections. The latter defended the Egyptian custom of worshipping
          animals, because, as he said, it is blasphemous to attempt to
          conceive an image of the Deity, and the Egyptians therefore
          concentrate the imagination of the worshipper on objects that are
          plainly merely allegorical or symbolical, and do not pretend to
          offer any such image (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          owned that it would be impossible to find a grander example of that
          noble love of truth, that sublime and scrupulous justice to
          opponents, which was the pre-eminent glory of ancient philosophers,
          and which, after the destruction of philosophy, was for many
          centuries almost unknown in the world. It is impossible to doubt
          that Epicureanism was logically compatible with a very high degree

          Injustice is a condition analogous to sickness, corruption,
          impotence in the body.... To possess a healthy body is desirable
          for its consequences as a means towards other constituents of
          happiness, but it is still more desirable in itself as an essential
          element of happiness <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          sickness, which would of itself make us miserable.... In like
          manner, the just mind blesses the possessor twice: first and
          chiefly by bringing to him happiness in itself; next, also, as it
          leads to ulterior happy results. The unjust mind is a curse to its
          possessor in itself and apart from results, though it also leads to
          ulterior results which render it still more a curse to

          deal on this point. He draws a distinction between affections and
          maladies. The first, he says, are irrational, and therefore
          reprehensible movements of the soul, which, if repeated and
          unrepressed, tend to form an irrational and evil habit, and to the
          last he in this letter restricts the term disease. He illustrates
          this distinction by observing that colds and any other slight
          ailments, if unchecked and neglected, may produce an organic
          disease. The wise man, he says, is wholly free from moral disease,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">The dispute about whether anything but
          virtue is a good, was, in reality, a somewhat childish quarrel
          about words; for the Stoics, who indignantly denounced the
          Peripatetics for maintaining the affirmative, admitted that health,
          friends, &amp;c., should be sought not as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“goods”</span> but as <span class=

          matter in Cicero (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Finib.</span></span> lib. iii. iv.). The
          Stoical doctrine of the equality of all vices was formally
          repudiated by Marcus Aurelius, who maintained (ii. 10), with
          Theophrastus, that faults of desire were worse than faults of
          anger. The other Stoics, while dogmatically asserting the equality
          of all virtues as well as the equality of all vices, in their
          particular judgments graduated their praise or blame much in the
          same way as the rest of the world.</dd>

          xxiv. Seneca desires that men should not commit suicide with panic
          or trepidation. He says that those condemned to death should await
          their execution, for <span class="tei tei-q">“it is a folly to die
          through fear of death;”</span> and he recommends men to support old
          age as long as their faculties remain unimpaired. On this last
          point, however, his language is somewhat contradictory. There is a
          good review of the opinions of the ancients in general, and of
          Seneca in particular, on this subject in Justus Lipsius'
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          the duty of patiently awaiting death. But in iii. 1, x. 8, 22-32,
          he clearly recognises the right of suicide in some cases,
          especially to prevent moral degeneracy. It must be remembered that
          the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Meditations</span></span> of Marcus Aurelius
          were private notes for his personal guidance, that all the Stoics
          admitted it to be wrong to commit suicide in cases where the act
          would be an injury to society, and that this consideration in
          itself would be sufficient to divert an emperor from the deed.
          Antoninus, the uncle, predecessor, and model of M. Aurelius, had
          considered it his duty several times to prevent Hadrian from
          committing suicide (Spartianus, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Hadrianus</span></span>). According to
          Capitolinus, Marcus Aurelius in his last illness purposely
          accelerated his death by abstinence. The duty of not hastily, or
          through cowardice, abandoning a path of duty, and the right of man
          to quit life when it appears intolerable, are combined very clearly
          by Epictetus, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          arbiter”</span>), was one of the most famous voluptuaries of the
          reign of Nero. Unlike most of his contemporaries, however, he was
          endowed with the most exquisite and refined taste; his graceful
          manners fascinated all about him, and made him in matters of
          pleasure the ruler of the Court. Appointed Proconsul of Bithynia,
          and afterwards Consul, he displayed the energies and the abilities
          of a statesman. A Court intrigue threw him out of favour; and
          believing that his death was resolved on, he determined to
          anticipate it by suicide. Calling his friends about him, he opened
          his veins, shut them, and opened them again; prolonged his
          lingering death till he had arranged his affairs; discoursed in his
          last moments, not about the immortality of the soul or the dogmas
          of philosophers, but about the gay songs and epigrams of the hour;
          and partaking of a cheerful banquet, died as recklessly as he had

          Blackstone, in his chapter on suicide, quotes the sentence of the
          Roman lawyers on the subject: <span class="tei tei-q">“Si quis
          impatientia doloris aut tædio vitæ aut morbo aut furore aut pudore
          mori maluit non animadvertatur in eum.”</span> Ulpian expressly
          asserts that the wills of suicides were recognised by law, and
          numerous examples of the act, notoriously prepared and publicly and
          gradually accomplished, prove its legality in Rome. Suetonius, it
          is true, speaks of Claudius accusing a man for having tried to kill
          himself (Claud, xvi.), and Xiphilin says (lxix. 8) that Hadrian
          gave special permission to the philosopher Euphrates to commit
          suicide, <span class="tei tei-q">“on account of old age and
          disease;”</span> but in the first case it appears from the context
          that a reproach and not a legal action was meant, while Euphrates,
          I suppose, asked permission to show his loyalty to the emperor, and
          not as a matter of strict necessity. There were, however, some
          Greek laws condemning suicide, probably on civic grounds. Josephus
          mentions (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Bell. Jud.</span></span> iii. 8) that in
          some nations <span class="tei tei-q">“the right hand of the suicide
          was amputated, and that in Judea the suicide was only buried after
          sunset.”</span> A very strange law, said to have been derived from
          Greece, is reported to have existed at Marseilles. Poison was kept
          by the senate of the city, and given to those who could prove that
          they had sufficient reason to justify their desire for death, and
          all other suicide was forbidden. The law was intended, it was said,
          to prevent hasty suicide, and to make deliberate suicide as rapid
          and painless as possible. (Valer. Maximus, ii. 6, § 7.) In the
          Reign of Terror in France, a law was made similar to that of
          Domitian. (Carlyle's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          about the debaucheries of Faustina, which the biographers of Marcus
          Aurelius have collected. It will be observed that the emperor
          himself has left an emphatic testimony to her virtue, and to the
          happiness he derived from her (i. 17); that the earliest extant
          biographer of Marcus Aurelius was a generation later; and that the

          Abstinentia Carnis</span></span>, devoted considerable research to
          this matter. Games were habitually celebrated by wealthy private
          individuals, during the early part of the empire, at the funerals
          of their relatives, but their mortuary character gradually ceased,
          and after Marcus Aurelius they had become mere public spectacles,
          and were rarely celebrated at Rome by private men. (See Wallon,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist. de
          l'Esclav.</span></span> tome ii. pp. 135-136.) The games had then
          really passed into their purely secular stage, though they were

          were several times made and violated. (Friedlænder, pp. 39-41.)
          Commodus is said to have been himself passionately fond of fighting
          as a gladiator. Much, however, of what Lampridius relates on this
          point is perfectly incredible. On the other hand, the profession of
          the gladiator was constantly spoken of as infamous; but this
          oscillation between extreme admiration and contempt will surprise
          no one who has noticed the tone continually adopted about
          prize-fighters in England, and about the members of some other
          professions on the Continent. Juvenal dwells (<span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">One of the surgeons of Charles II.
          named John Brown, whose official duty it was to superintend the
          ceremony, and who assures us that he has witnessed many thousands
          touched, has written an extremely curious account of it, called
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Charisma
          Basilicon</span></span> (London, 1684). This miraculous power
          existed exclusively in the English and French royal families, being
          derived, in the first, from Edward the Confessor, in the second,
          from St. Lewis. A surgeon attested the reality of the disease
          before the miracle was performed. The king hung a riband with a
          gold coin round the neck of the person touched; but Brown thinks
          the gold, though possessing great virtue, was not essential to the
          cure. He had known cases where the cured person had sold, or ceased
          to wear, the medal, and his disease returned. The gift was
          unimpaired by the Reformation, and an obdurate Catholic was
          converted on finding that Elizabeth, after the Pope's
          excommunication, could cure his scrofula. Francis I. cured many
          persons when prisoner in Spain. Charles I., when a prisoner, cured
          a man by his simple benediction, the Puritans not permitting him to
          touch him. His blood had the same efficacy; and Charles II., when
          an exile in the Netherlands, still retained it. There were,
          however, some <span class="tei tei-q">“Atheists, Sadducees, and
          ill-conditioned Pharisees”</span> who even then disbelieved it; and
          Brown gives the letter of one who went, a complete sceptic, to
          satisfy his friends, and came away cured and converted. It was
          popularly, but Brown says erroneously, believed that the touch was
          peculiarly efficacious on Good Friday. An official register was
          kept, for every month in the reign of Charles II., of the persons
          touched, but two years and a half appear to be wanting. The
          smallest number touched in one year was 2,983 (in 1669); the total,
          in the whole reign, 92,107. Brown gives numbers of specific cases
          with great detail. Shakspeare has noticed the power (<span class=

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This theory, which is developed at

          notion that the human soul is a part of the Deity, and therefore by
          nature a participator in the Divine attribute of prescience. The
          soul, however, was crushed by the weight of the body; and there
          were two ways of evoking its prescience—the ascetic way, which
          attenuates the body, and the magical way, which stimulates the
          soul. Apollonius declared that his power of prophecy was not due to
          magic, but solely to his abstinence from animal food. (Philost.
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ap. of
          Tyana</span></span>, viii. 5.) Among those who believed the
          oracles, there were two theories. The first was that they were
          inspired by dæmons or spirits of a degree lower than the gods. The
          second was, that they were due to the action of certain vapours
          which emanated from the caverns beneath the temples, and which, by
          throwing the priestess into a state of delirium, evoked her
          prophetic powers. The first theory was that of the Platonists, and
          it was adopted by the Christians, who, however, changed the
          signification of the word dæmon. The second theory, which appears
          to be due to Aristotle (Baltus, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Réponse à l'Histoire
          des Oracles</span></span>, p. 132), is noticed by Cic. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Div.</span></span>
          i. 19; Plin. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">H. N.</span></span> ii. 95; and others. It is
          closely allied to the modern belief in clairvoyance. Plutarch, in
          his treatise on the decline of the oracles, attributes that decline
          sometimes to the death of the dæmons (who were believed to be
          mortal), and sometimes to the exhaustion of the vapours. The
          oracles themselves, according to Porphyry (Fontenelle, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist. des
          Oracles</span></span>, pp. 220-222, first ed.), attributed it to
          the second cause. Iamblichus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Myst.</span></span> § iii. c. xi.) combines
          both theories, and both are very clearly stated in the following
          curious passage: <span class="tei tei-q">“Quamquam Platoni credam
          inter deos atque homines, natura et loco medias quasdam divorum
          potestates intersitas, easque divinationes cunctas et magorum
          miracula gubernare. Quin et illud mecum reputo, posse animum
          humanum, præsertim, puerilem et simplicem, seu carminum avocamento,
          sive odorum delenimento, soporari, et ad oblivionem præsentium
          externari: et paulis per remota corporis memoria, redigi ac redire
          ad naturam suam, quæ est immortalis scilicet et divina; atque ita
          veluti quodam sopore, futura rerum præsagire.”</span>—Apuleius,

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">See his very curious Life by
          Philostratus. This Life was written at the request of Julia Domna,
          the wife of Septimus Severus, whether or not with the intention of
          opposing the Gospel narrative is a question still fiercely
          discussed. Among the most recent Church historians, Pressensé
          maintains the affirmative, and Neander the negative. Apollonius was
          born at nearly the same time as Christ, but outlived Domitian. The
          traces of his influence are widely spread through the literature of
          the empire. Eunapius calls him <span class="tei tei-q">“Ἀπολλώνιος
          ὁ ἐκ Τυάνων, οὐκέτι φιλόσοφος ἀλλ᾽ ἦν τι θεῶν τε καὶ ἀνθρώπου

          relates (lxvii. 18) the story, told also by Philostratus, how
          Apollonius, being at Ephesus, saw the assassination of Domitian at
          Rome. Alexander Severus placed (<span class=

          Orpheus, Abraham, and Christ, for worship in his oratory. Aurelian
          was reported to have been diverted from his intention of destroying
          Tyana by the ghost of the philosopher, who appeared in his tent,
          rebuked him, and saved the city (Vopiscus, <span class=

          Pagan philosopher Hierocles wrote a book opposing Apollonius to
          Christ, which was answered by Eusebius. The Fathers of the fourth
          century always spoke of him as a great magician. Some curious
          passages on the subject are collected by M. Chassang, in the

          generation after Apuleius, and who, like him, was a Carthaginian,
          has never even mentioned him. During the fourth century his
          reputation revived, and Lactantius, St. Jerome, and St. Augustine
          relate that many miracles were attributed to him, and that he was
          placed by the Pagans on a level with Christ, and regarded by some

          the Fathers. There were, however, two forms of Pagan miracles about
          which there was some hesitation in the early Church—the beneficent
          miracle of healing and the miracle of prophecy. Concerning the
          first, the common opinion was that the dæmons only cured diseases
          they had themselves caused, or that, at least, if they ever (in
          order to enthral men more effectually) cured purely natural
          diseases, they did it by natural means, which their superior
          knowledge and power placed at their disposal. Concerning prophecy,
          it was the opinion of some of the Fathers that intuitive prescience
          was a Divine prerogative, and that the prescience of the dæmons was
          only acquired by observation. Their immense knowledge enabled them
          to forecast events to a degree far transcending human faculties,
          and they employed this power in the oracles.</dd>

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">This has been a matter of very great
          controversy. Looking at the question apart from direct testimony,
          it appears improbable that a persecution directed against the
          Christians on the charge of having burnt Rome, should have extended
          to Christians who did not live near Rome. On the other hand, it has
          been argued that Tacitus speaks of them as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“haud perinde in crimine incendii, quam odio humani
          generis convicti;”</span> and it has been maintained that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“hatred of the human race”</span> was
          treated as a crime, and punished in the provinces. But this is, I
          think, extremely far-fetched; and it is evident from the sequel
          that the Christians at Rome were burnt as incendiaries, and that it
          was the conviction that they were not guilty of that crime that
          extorted the pity which Tacitus notices. There is also no reference
          in Tacitus to any persecution beyond the walls. If we pass to the
          Christian evidence, a Spanish inscription referring to the Neronian
          persecution, which was once appealed to as decisive, is now
          unanimously admitted to be a forgery. In the fourth century,
          however, Sulp. Severus (lib. ii.) and Orosius (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hist.</span></span>
          vii. 7) declared that general laws condemnatory of Christianity
          were promulgated by Nero; but the testimony of credulous historians
          who wrote so long after the event is not of much value. Rossi,
          however, imagines that a fragment of an inscription found at
          Pompeii indicates a general law against Christians. See his
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Bulletino
          d'Archeologia Cristiana</span></span> (Roma, Dec. 1865), which,
          however, should be compared with the very remarkable <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Compte
          rendu</span></span> of M. Aubé, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Acad. des Inscrip. et
          Belles-lettres</span></span>, Juin 1866. These two papers contain
          an almost complete discussion of the persecutions of Nero and
          Domitian. Gibbon thinks it quite certain the persecution was
          confined to the city; Mosheim (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Eccl.
          Hist.</span></span> i. p. 71) adopts the opposite view, and appeals
          to the passage in Tertullian (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ap.</span></span> v.), in which he speaks of
          <span class="tei tei-q">“leges istæ ... quas Trajanus ex parte
          frustratus est, vitando inquiri Christianos,”</span> as implying
          the existence of special laws against the Christians. This passage,
          however, may merely refer to the general law against unauthorised
          religions, which Tertullian notices in this very chapter; and
          Pliny, in his famous letter, does not show any knowledge of the
          existence of special legislation about the Christians.</dd>

          questioned it. At the same time, it is very probable, as Mr.

          381-384), that though the pretext of the execution might have been
          religious, the real motive was political jealousy. Domitian had
          already put to death the brother of Flavius Clemens on the charge
          of treason. His sons had been recognised as successors to the
          throne, and at the time of his execution another leading noble
          named Glabrio was accused of having fought in the arena. Some
          ecclesiastical historians have imagined that there may have been
          two Domitillas—the wife and niece of Flavius Clemens. The islands

          There are only two cases of alleged martyrdom before this time that
          can excite any reasonable doubt. Irenæus distinctly asserts that
          Telesphorus was martyred; but his martyrdom is put in the beginning
          of the reign of Antoninus Pius (he had assumed the mitre near the
          end of the reign of Hadrian), and Antoninus is represented, by the
          general voice of the Church, as perfectly free from the stain of
          persecution. A tradition, which is in itself sufficiently probable,
          states that Pontianus, having been exiled by Maximinus, was killed

          all, to impose his shackling tyranny upon the human mind. The very

          having published a history in which he had praised Brutus and
          called Cassius the last of Romans. (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Annal.</span></span>
          iv. 34-35.) He expressly terms this <span class="tei tei-q">“novo
          ac tunc primum audito crimine,”</span> and he puts a speech in the
          mouth of the accused, describing the liberty previously accorded to
          writers. Cordus avoided execution by suicide. His daughter, Marcia,
          preserved some copies of his work, and published it in the reign
          and with the approbation of Caligula. (Senec. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ad.
          Marc.</span></span> 1; Suet. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Calig.</span></span> 16.) There are, however,
          some traces of an earlier persecution of letters. Under the
          sanction of a law of the decemvirs against libellers, Augustus
          exiled the satiric writer Cassius Severus, and he also destroyed
          the works of an historian named Labienus, on account of their
          seditious sentiments. These writings were re-published with those
          of Cordus. Generally, however, Augustus was very magnanimous in his
          dealings with his assailants. He refused the request of Tiberius to
          punish them (Suet. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Aug.</span></span> 51), and only excluded from
          his palace Timagenes, who bitterly satirised both him and the
          empress, and proclaimed himself everywhere the enemy of the
          emperor. (Senec. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Ira</span></span>, iii. 23.) A similar
          magnanimity was shown by most of the other emperors; among others,
          by Nero. (Suet. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Nero</span></span>, 39.) Under Vespasian,
          however, a poet, named Maternus, was obliged to retouch a tragedy
          on Cato (Tacit. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">De Or.</span></span> 2-3), and Domitian
          allowed no writings opposed to his policy. (Tacit. <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Agric.</span></span>)
          But no attempt appears to have been made in the Empire to control
          religious writings till the persecution of Diocletian, who ordered
          the Scriptures to be burnt. The example was speedily followed by
          the Christian emperors. The writings of Arius were burnt in

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">Eusebius, it is true, ascribes this
          persecution (vi. 39) to the hatred Decius bore to his predecessor
          Philip, who was very friendly to the Christians. But although such
          a motive might account for a persecution like that of Maximin,
          which was directed chiefly against the bishops who had been about
          the Court of Severus, it is insufficient to account for a
          persecution so general and so severe as that of Decius. It is
          remarkable that this emperor is uniformly represented by the Pagan
          historians as an eminently wise and humane sovereign. See Dodwell,

          The Montanists maintained that such a conduct was equivalent to

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">De Fuga in
          Persecutione</span></span>, maintaining this view; and among the

          his courage by his death) did not escape animadversion. The more
          moderate opinion prevailed, but the leading bishops found it
          necessary to support their conduct by declaring that they had
          received special revelations exhorting them to fly. St. Cyprian,
          who constantly appealed to his dreams to justify him in his

          1. Dionysius says, Gallus began the persecution when his reign was

          <dd class="tei tei-notetext">There is one instance of a wholesale
          massacre which appears to rest on good authority. Eusebius asserts
          that, during the Diocletian persecution, a village in Phrygia, the
          name of which he does not mention, being inhabited entirely by
          Christians who refused to sacrifice, was attacked and burnt with
          all that were in it by the Pagan soldiery. Lactantius (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Inst.
          Div.</span></span> v. 11) confines the conflagration to a church in
          which the entire population was burnt; and an early Latin
          translation of Eusebius states that the people were first summoned
          to withdraw, but refused to do so. Gibbon (ch. xvi.) thinks that
          this tragedy took place when the decree of Diocletian ordered the
          destruction of the churches.</dd>

          Besides these martyrs, 17,000 persons in Spain recanted, and
          endured punishments less than death, while great numbers fled.

              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
